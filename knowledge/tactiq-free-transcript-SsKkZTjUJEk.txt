00:00:00.320 welcome to the Hubberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life
00:00:09.200 i'm Andrew Huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and opthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine my guest
00:00:15.759 today is Michael Easter michael Easter is a professor at the University of Nevada Las Vegas and a world-renowned
00:00:22.000 writer his recent work has focused on how modern conveniences undermine our mental and our physical health and as
00:00:28.400 importantly the daily weekly monthly and yearly steps we can all take to not just offset the damages of those conveniences
00:00:35.200 but to continue to grow and improve our ability to focus to do meaningful and creative work and to derive deeper
00:00:41.440 connection with others one of the reasons Michael Easter is on this podcast is that his book The Comfort
00:00:46.480 Crisis changed my daily life the comfort crisis made me realize that every activity available to us easy or
00:00:52.640 challenging destructive or constructive can and should be viewed through the lens of whether it spends our dopamine
00:00:58.559 reserves or invests them in a worthwhile way this is a key distinction that we don't often hear about but it's one that
00:01:05.280 can help you access much greater levels of focus and motivation to be able to avoid and get over addictive or
00:01:10.880 compulsive behaviors and it also brings about greater meaning and depth of connection to your relationships and
00:01:15.920 leisure time during today's discussion Michael and I explore these ideas and their practical implementation including
00:01:22.000 how you can tailor them to your own life he explains how our choices in the physical world and in the online world
00:01:27.920 shape us over time and how to make better choices about both on a daily basis he also provides the practical
00:01:33.520 steps of how to get mentally stronger you know we hear about getting mentally stronger a lot but he explains exactly
00:01:38.720 how to do that as well as how to live with a pervasive sense of gratitude i'm certain that everyone young old male
00:01:45.360 female maybe you're driven or maybe you're more laid-back type of person will benefit from and be changed by the
00:01:50.560 conversation with Michael Easter the information and tools he offers and shares are that good before we begin I'd
00:01:56.799 like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of
00:02:01.840 my desire and effort to bring zerocost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general
00:02:07.280 public in keeping with that theme today's episode does include sponsors and now for my discussion with Michael
00:02:13.360 Easter michael Easter welcome thanks for having me man you've changed my life
00:02:14.000 No text
00:02:18.720 really you have tell me more you've changed my behavior on a daily basis so
00:02:24.080 a ex-girlfriend of mine who lives in Colorado and I were in a discussion
00:02:29.440 about the best place to live and raise kids and she grew up in the mountains of
00:02:34.640 Colorado and she had just listened to your book uh The Comfort Crisis and she
00:02:42.319 was saying I think this is the reason why people in her hometown are so mentally robust into their 70s 80s even
00:02:50.879 90s her grandparents were really robust i think they lived into their 90s or late 80s at least uh and we talked about
00:02:59.599 her childhood a bit around this and she said that her mom actually used to take her and put her in a basket and put her
00:03:06.800 into the river and just send her down river to a friend's house and I mean this is the kind of stuff that nowadays you like you know parents like lose
00:03:13.120 their mind yeah like Moses like Exactly um and that she you know grew up in cold
00:03:19.680 water in the morning and um and of course skiing and doing all the things they do in Colorado but she was
00:03:25.040 absolutely convinced that the uh the sort of bodily expectation of daily
00:03:31.120 activity meaning just a sort of level of energy and almost stress if she didn't
00:03:36.400 um get a ton of outdoor movement every day um was determined by that early
00:03:42.879 upbringing of just being outdoors almost all the time and doing hard things and experiencing cold and things of that
00:03:48.239 sort so uh I read the book um and started doing hard things on a regular
00:03:54.720 basis mostly rocking but it has been a few years since I've had a really big adventure and we'll talk about big
00:04:01.200 adventures that include some actual danger and I make it a point each week
00:04:06.799 to write down one thing that I'm going to do that is truly uncomfortable so thank you for changing my life for the
00:04:13.040 better it's uh transformed my mental health and I was already feeling really good amazing i love that it's great so
00:04:20.399 let's talk about modern life versus um ancient nervous systems right i think
00:04:26.080 this is um a big theme in in your writing and your life um what do you
00:04:32.320 think the human brain and nervous system were quote unquote designed to do i'm
00:04:37.919 not implying uh the the origins of the design that's a different podcast but what do you think the human species is
00:04:44.800 really organized to do and how do you think that fits into modern life or doesn't fit into modern life well I
00:04:51.440 think that we evolved in a context where we had to do hard things all the time life was uncomfortable right you were
00:04:57.360 out you spent 100% of your time outdoors uh it was often too hot too cold you
00:05:03.040 were physically active all day people walked something like 20,000 steps a day on average and by the way as you were
00:05:08.479 taking those steps you're usually carrying something heavy right this could be your child it could be tools it
00:05:13.600 could be an animal that you took down you had to carry the meat back to camp you also had long periods of downtime
00:05:20.240 that were unstimulated where you would talk to other people face to face i mean life was just it was effortful
00:05:27.280 it was challenging and you had to do those challenges and go through those discomforts in order to survive and I
00:05:35.039 think that the sort of uh promise and peril of modern life is that we no
00:05:40.960 longer have to do these hard challenging things to survive right if you want food
00:05:47.759 you can go to the gas station on the corner and get it there's just ample food i think we throw out about a third
00:05:53.440 of the food that we produce um physically we obviously have to do a lot less physical activity to survive if you
00:06:00.560 want to go somewhere you just hop in your car you walk across the parking lot um you could actually just exist in your
00:06:07.280 house and not really move right you could like do Uber Eats for all your food you could work behind the screen so
00:06:12.639 we've really removed that physical discomfort out of our life um and I also
00:06:17.759 think you know even something like boredom like boredom is an uncomfortable thing and now when we feel boredom we
00:06:24.800 have this like very easy effortless escape from it in the form of a phone temperature swings right we can live at
00:06:30.960 72 degrees i mean this list goes on and on and on i could answer this question for for like hours but I think that
00:06:36.560 listeners get the point that we evolved in these environments of discomfort
00:06:41.759 and now we have shifted over to environments that are much more comfortable now let me be clear this is
00:06:48.800 a good shift in the grand scheme of time and space but it does come with problems because you find that because we're
00:06:54.880 involved in environments of discomfort I think humans um are sort of wired to do
00:07:00.160 the next easiest most comfortable thing because that would have served us in the past right in the past you didn't want
00:07:06.240 to move too much just for the sake of it because you wanted to conserve calories if you had the opportunity to eat a
00:07:12.560 little more food you would probably do that because that would give you a survival advantage right you put on some fat you didn't want to spend too much
00:07:19.360 time if it was too much too cold or something um and so we're wired to do
00:07:24.400 the easy thing but now we end up in this sort of easier world and those sort of instincts we have I think backfire so
00:07:31.759 call this an evolutionary mismatch really i'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge our sponsor Maui Newi
00:07:35.000 No text
00:07:38.400 Venison maui Newi venison is the most nutrient-dense and delicious red meat available it's also ethically sourced
00:07:44.960 maui Nui hunts and harvest wild access deer on the island of Maui this solves the problem of managing an invasive
00:07:51.280 species while also creating an extraordinary source of protein as I've discussed on this podcast before most
00:07:57.440 people should aim for getting one gram of quality protein per pound of body weight each day this allows for optimal
00:08:03.039 muscle protein synthesis while also helping to reduce appetite and support proper metabolic health given Maui's
00:08:09.199 exceptional protein to calorie ratio this protein target is achievable without having to eat too many calories
00:08:15.360 their venison delivers 21 grams of protein with only 107 gram per serving which is an ideal ratio for those of us
00:08:22.240 concerned with maintaining or increasing muscle mass while supporting metabolic health they have venison steaks ground
00:08:28.319 venison and venison bone broth i personally love all of them in fact I probably eat a Maui Newi venison burger
00:08:34.640 pretty much every day and if I don't do that I eat one of their steaks and sometimes I also consume their bone broth and if you're on the go they have
00:08:41.120 Maui Nui venison sticks which have 10 grams of protein per stick with just 55 calories i eat at least one of those a
00:08:47.519 day to meet my protein requirements right now Maui Newi is offering Huberman podcast listeners a limited collection
00:08:53.200 of my favorite cuts and products it's perfect for anyone looking to improve their diet with delicious highquality
00:08:58.480 protein supplies are limited so go to mauynew venison.com/huberman to get access to this highquality meat
00:09:05.200 today again that's mauienewivenenison.com/huberman today's episode is also brought to us by
00:09:11.040 Helixleep helix makes mattresses and pillows that are customized to your unique sleep needs now I've spoken many
00:09:17.680 times before on this and other podcasts about the fact that getting a great night's sleep is the foundation of mental health physical health and
00:09:23.920 performance now the mattress you sleep on makes a huge difference in the quality of sleep that you get each night how soft it is or how firm it is all
00:09:30.959 play into your comfort and need to be tailored to your unique sleep needs if you go to the Helix website you can take
00:09:36.720 a brief two-minute quiz and it will ask you questions such as "Do you sleep on your back your side or your stomach do you tend to run hot or cold during the
00:09:42.959 night?" Things of that sort maybe you know the answers to those questions maybe you don't either way Helix will
00:09:48.320 match you to the ideal mattress for you for me that turned out to be the Dusk mattress i started sleeping on a Dusk
00:09:53.760 mattress about three and a half years ago and it's been far and away the best sleep that I've ever had if you'd like
00:09:59.040 to try Helix Sleep you can go to helixleep.com/huberman take that two-minute sleep quiz and
00:10:04.480 Helix will match you to a mattress that's customized to you right now Helix is giving up to 27% off all mattress
00:10:10.320 orders again that's helixleep.com/huberman to get up to 27% off

00:10:17.120 as a neurobiologist and in some sense a comparative neurobiologist I like to step back and say you know what what is
00:10:23.920 a species uh you know trying to optimize for it sounds like a lot of what we were trying to optimize for throughout human
00:10:30.240 history is to limit discomfort um and of course ensure the species persists so
00:10:38.079 reproduction is key and then making sure that our offspring which need a lot of
00:10:43.120 care over a long period of time compared to other species are taken care of like when you step back as like pure evolutionary lens um it to me seems
00:10:50.959 pretty much that simple uh and all the rest is noise as they say so if our goal
00:10:56.000 in human evolution is to rid ourselves of discomfort and make things easier and safer and propagate the species then why
00:11:04.720 at some point is more comfort bad for us there are side effects that happen right
00:11:10.480 um and when you look at most of the diseases that kill us today they are a
00:11:15.680 result of usually overconumption of food right we eat too much uh far more than we often need um we don't move enough
00:11:22.800 there's a lot tied to sort of metabolic health and so I think that I put this in the I like to say these are good
00:11:30.079 problems to have in the grand scheme of time and space right i would prefer to
00:11:35.600 have my problem be that oh I have to go exercise or something to take care of my physical activity than the fact that
00:11:41.920 like oh I have to I have to go hunt and gather every single day like to get my food but I do think that they are
00:11:49.120 problems that we need to solve the fact that you know a lot of our modern problems are driven by the fact that our
00:11:55.760 environments have become so comfortable does that answer your question yeah that that answers the question i I heard
00:12:01.360 someone say recently that a lot of what exists now in health and wellness is just trying to bring the outdoors
00:12:06.560 indoors so I I've tried to persuade as everyone knows people to get outside in the morning get sunlight in their eyes for all sorts of reasons um but you know
00:12:13.839 the whole business with red light you know long wavelength light infrared light you can use one of those panels it
00:12:19.839 can be quite useful there's also a lot of long wavelength light coming from the sun um fresh air we could debate
00:12:26.560 grounding um but many people believe it's helpful uh green spaces i mean kind
00:12:32.800 of agree with this idea that you know so much of what we're encouraging people to do is just um mimic doing what we used
00:12:39.600 to do all the time it's what life used to be right we like I said we spend 100% of our time in the outdoors we evolved
00:12:46.480 in the outdoors that is kind of like our natural environment and I think um to continue with this example when you put
00:12:51.920 us in four walls where we don't get that outdoor exposure some interesting
00:12:57.200 psychological things start to happen that probably aren't that good for us um
00:13:02.240 and this you can apply this idea to everything like I said like even physical activity it's like exercise is
00:13:08.399 a great example to me no one exercised in the past right exercise is something
00:13:14.240 that we made up basically after the industrial revolution because what happened is we get these jobs where now
00:13:20.000 we're much more sedentary and we start to realize oh these people who have the jobs where they sit all day they're
00:13:27.040 getting these strange new health problems that we've never seen and yet the people who are kind of moving around
00:13:32.480 all day still in their jobs they don't seem to get those problems so maybe activity is the difference maker hey you
00:13:38.240 guys that are sitting all day I want you to just go move around for the sake of it no there's no actual point to it just
00:13:43.519 like move around for the sake of it that'll improve your health and this becomes this idea of of exercise
00:13:49.040 movement for the sake of it which is this kind of strange idea in the grand
00:13:54.959 scheme of time and space but it does make sense in the context of a world where the average American is walking
00:14:02.320 you know 4,000 to 6,000 steps a day that's how we get our activities we have to manufacture it effectively and I will
00:14:10.000 say though to continue with your example about how we sort of uh mimic what we
00:14:15.199 used to do in the past um I do think that when we we try to solve for these problems sometimes uh the way we do it
00:14:21.040 is sort of interesting we go okay if we need to move more well what if we got um
00:14:26.320 what if we got a belt and we put a motor on it and a person could just run on this belt in this air conditioned
00:14:33.519 building oh and and then we'll put a television there and that way you can just watch CNN blare insane information
00:14:40.240 into your face the entire time and be totally distracted yeah that sounds like a good idea but when we do that what are
00:14:47.839 we missing so when a person runs outdoors on the other hand let's say it's on a trail well now you have all
00:14:54.320 these other forms of discomfort and stimulation that are coming your way so one you've got the physical activity
00:15:01.040 obviously but two is that the trail isn't this perfectly predictable thing right if I'm on the treadmill I can go
00:15:07.040 okay 1% incline I'm going to run six miles an hour and I just do that i don't have to think about it well the trail
00:15:13.120 it's going to go up and down you're going to have rocks and ruts you have to navigate under that's a mental challenge
00:15:18.480 you're also going to have to think about the weather right now oh I have to deal with the temperature changes oh that looks like a storm might be coming in
00:15:25.199 there's also so much more that you take in from the environment you run through trees you run into open spaces and that
00:15:32.959 has I think a real emotional and I would say even spiritual benefit from that nature you're going to see totally
00:15:39.519 random things right like my favorite thing is when I go run on trails in Las Vegas and like you see that random
00:15:46.160 coyote or the big horn sheep and it's just like this is it mountain lion mountain lion right have you Have you
00:15:52.240 seen mountain lions i've seen them other places but not in Vegas unfortunately most people would say fortunately I'm on the other side like mountain lion's not
00:15:58.399 going to hurt you but if you get to see one that's an opportunity i don't know that video of that kid in Colorado you know where it's chasing him oh yeah or
00:16:04.959 or stalking him and we could talk about that i totally agree i think that um optic flow that uh of the sort that you
00:16:12.000 get out when you're hiking or walking or cycling or um more dangerous activity like motorcycling out ofdoors um we know
00:16:20.000 that it has a powerful effect in suppressing some of the areas of the brain involved in fear i don't know if you're familiar with this literature but
00:16:26.320 Francine Shapiro who was um actually ran her clinic behind Stanford uh for a
00:16:31.519 while who came up with EMDR this eye movement uh desensization uh
00:16:36.880 reprocessing for trauma um came up with that on a walk and developed the lateral
00:16:42.880 eye movements that are the cornerstone of EMDR as a way to bring the walk into her clinic interesting because and then
00:16:50.959 for years I would hear about this and I thought it was complete garbage i was like this there's as a neuroscientist I
00:16:56.320 was like no and people would say oh you know the eye movements mimic rapid eye movements in sleep that's why it works
00:17:01.920 and no they don't look anything like the rapid eye movements in sleep by the way they'd say oh you know it's um creating
00:17:07.520 cross hemispheric uh activation of the two sides of the brain no I mean you get that if you have binocular vision you
00:17:14.640 know vision scientists i was like no that's ridiculous but and somewhere around 2016 to 2020 there were four
00:17:22.319 papers and then an additional paper in animal uh an animal study so some there's a mix of animal and human data
00:17:28.559 showing that when um animals or humans engage in this uh lateralized repetitive
00:17:34.240 eye movement back and forth that it suppresses among other areas the amydala so amydala activation you know troughs
00:17:41.679 and so there's something about forward ambulation nerds speak for walking and running right that um suppresses the the
00:17:48.400 fear areas of the brain and I'm convinced that this is a a a central reason why movement out ofdoors is so
00:17:55.280 fundamentally different on our psyche um and our level of calm uh as compared to
00:18:00.960 running on a treadmill or um god forbid just sitting at a desk all day yeah and that makes sense and I would wonder
00:18:06.799 evolutionarily if that would be um for hunting so something like persistence
00:18:12.160 hunting right that's a dangerous act yes you have to hunt every single day that's how you're going to survive to get that
00:18:17.919 food at the same time it's still very perilous right you're not walking down to Walmart and getting stuff and so if
00:18:23.440 you had that fear suppression in the context of an act that is somewhat dangerous that would probably give you
00:18:28.960 an advantage to actually end up taking down that animal huge there's a a video
00:18:34.160 of a um some hunters it appears to be in Africa forgive me uh for not knowing exactly where it was um
00:18:42.480 prepared to essentially walk towards a group of lions that have have are on a kill and the lions look up from the kill
00:18:49.760 and there are these hunters walking like with spears vertical right and the the lions are like "Wait what's going on
00:18:55.679 here?" You know typically this is the other the scenario is the other way around are you familiar with this video
00:19:00.880 no and that the hunters they're translating into the captions and assuming it's accurate they're saying you know it's key that we just keep
00:19:06.559 moving forward and that confuses the lions and they think that you know that because we're continuing to look at them
00:19:12.880 and move forward they'll move off the kill but if we avert our our gaze then they won't and we can get attacked and
00:19:19.200 it's happened before and they literally walk these lions off the kill and the lions are you can see that they're
00:19:24.559 they're perplexed but like they're like "These guys aren't afraid at all." And they just start backing away and a couple of them are negotiating in their
00:19:31.440 minds you can see and they basically walk these lines off the kill and take the kill and there's so much going on
00:19:37.840 there that but it relates to what we're talking about but forward ambulation in the context of hunting I I I agree with
00:19:44.080 you i think it could have um huge implications also a great metaphor for life right there right it's like just
00:19:50.960 keep moving forward if you just kind of focus on the kill as it were and just
00:19:56.799 keep moving forward don't hesitate like that can get you pretty far so you're a
00:20:01.000 No text
00:20:02.160 writer but you get into the outdoors a lot i do and you do hard scary things on purpose
00:20:10.160 on Yeah so I'm curious about the um the younger Michael Easter when you were a
00:20:16.160 kid were you the kid that would would like hold on to the firecracker to the very last second were you the kid that
00:20:21.360 was like "Let's jump that roof into the pool." I'm not giving suggestions here but I I knew kids like that they usually were named Johnny for whatever reason
00:20:28.559 there's a correlation there were you that kid or were you the the writer kid so I was not the kid that would hold the
00:20:35.760 firecracker to the last second um jump from the second story into the pool and
00:20:40.960 I'm still not that person i'm a person where if I had a good reason what what sort of bigger thing is
00:20:49.360 holding that firecracker till the last end going to give me then I'm perfectly willing to accept that risk okay so the
00:20:57.120 things that I do that um might be considered dangerous or challenging
00:21:02.640 I always assume there's going to be a greater reward at the end you know I'm not just
00:21:08.320 doing something hard for the sake of doing something hard think about it like you're skateboarding okay as you were
00:21:15.600 learning how to skateboard I'm sure you fell a lot yeah all the time you banged yourself up got all these scuffs on your
00:21:22.240 arm but the point wasn't to fall no falling however was something that came
00:21:28.960 as you got better as a skateboarder right so the point is not to fall the point is to go okay what is the overall
00:21:34.480 goal be better as a skateboarder and in the process I'm probably going to have to do some things that maybe bang me up
00:21:40.240 a little bit that have some element of danger but to focus on that overall goal so I'd say I've always been um like that
00:21:47.280 and I personally find um as a journalist I mean I read a lot of studies i speak
00:21:54.000 to experts i call people like you who have a PhD pick their brain um but I also find that um sometime I get the
00:22:00.960 best information and can better process it and put it into a narrative that um someone can identify with and maybe
00:22:07.280 learn from it more if I have if I actually go to the source and I have a story around that and sometimes for me
00:22:12.880 going to the source leads me into places that are a little bit I would say off the beaten path maybe yeah sometimes I
00:22:18.799 go to labs you know and it's there's no danger there um plenty of coffee nice and air conditioned um nothing's going
00:22:24.320 to go wrong but you know my work has taken me to some war zones to the middle of the jungle in the Amazon um I went up
00:22:32.000 to the Arctic for 30 days i just completed this long hike in the middle of nowhere Utah um and I do find that on
00:22:39.200 those trips that's where you start to peel back the deeper layers of whatever
00:22:44.799 idea I'm trying to communicate so I think that there's a big difference between um intellectual understanding
00:22:51.919 and experiential understanding and it's that experiential understanding like I want to get to the heart of that i want
00:22:58.480 to get to the heart of that because if I can communicate that I have a higher probability of getting a person who
00:23:04.320 reads my work to perhaps take an action that could improve their life and it
00:23:09.360 doesn't have to be big i'm not suggesting people have to go to the jungle or go up to the Arctic but I am
00:23:14.799 saying start where you're at and do something that's maybe a little bit out of your comfort zone maybe a little bit
00:23:20.000 of a challenge and see how it goes oh you didn't die great maybe try it the
00:23:26.000 next day and the next day and so by sort of continuously pushing that edge I think that people find that you don't
00:23:32.559 fall off the edge the edge tends to expand and as the edge expands you end up a better person
00:23:39.000 No text
00:23:39.440 yeah I definitely want to talk about your 2% rule and and some of the other um actionable items that uh you've
00:23:45.840 delineated in your books and elsewhere in your in your Substack i want to sort of um it's not a
00:23:53.200 challenge it's a it's a question about okay if humans have introduced so many
00:23:58.240 comforts to their lives that uh small things feel uncomfortable like for me um
00:24:04.000 I like flying places but I don't like airports um I I travel I travel with a
00:24:10.080 lot of supplements i'm always secondary screened i don't check luggage and it's funny because um uh it's such a small
00:24:17.200 thing right to wait for your bag to be secondary screened but you know these things can become annoyances you know
00:24:22.640 we're human and I I love to laugh at myself uh when I get annoyed about these little things you go "Oh like this thing
00:24:28.559 bothered me or something." You know it's um so if we lower our threshold for what we consider challenging and I'm making
00:24:35.200 myself the the the butt of the joke here but it's pretty serious if you look out and think okay you know some people that
00:24:42.080 they're hearing us talk about doing hard things but for many people even though there's so many comforts um life feels
00:24:50.080 hard it's like work is hard uh you know things are expensive um it's hard to get
00:24:55.760 enough sleep uh everyone's always blaring at us at at all the things we're supposed to be doing the the world seems
00:25:01.200 unstable so I think many people already feel like they're inundated with challenge even though we're talking
00:25:07.440 about the the creature comforts that we all enjoy so if somebody wants to start
00:25:12.880 exploring leaning into discomfort in the way that grows them and actually makes those other discomforts that we're
00:25:18.880 talking about kind of dissolve away h how should they start to go about that
00:25:24.080 so a couple things um come to mind and I'm trying to think how to get into it and what I think that I will um use is
00:25:31.840 an example of myself and then I'll kind of unpack that and I'll unpack it at a level um where we talk about something more it's kind of a big challenge and
00:25:38.640 then also something like people can use every day so I'll give you the example of um for the comfort crisis I go and I
00:25:44.240 spend 30 days in the Arctic a little more than 30 days now when I fly up
00:25:49.760 there I fly from uh Las Vegas to Anchorage Anchorage to Katsub which is
00:25:54.960 this little town just 20 miles above the Arctic Circle and then from Katsub you get in a plane that is about the size of
00:26:00.240 a pack of gum and you take that plane out you know more than 100 miles into the Arctic and it drops you off now when
00:26:06.880 I get on that plane from Vegas it's like a 747 and I'm like you i hate flying right
00:26:14.400 because seats are too small and cramped plane's too hot the movies in the seat
00:26:19.520 back they suck right the coffee not very good there's usually a baby crying if I
00:26:25.760 need to go to the bathroom bathroom's totally cramped like flying is just terrible i'm like flying is the worst
00:26:31.840 and then I go spend this 30 days in the middle of the Arctic right so if I want to drink anything I got to hike down to
00:26:38.240 a stream and I got to carry the heavy water bags back up to camp i am freezing
00:26:43.360 cold the entire freaking time if I want to go to the bathroom I have to hike out
00:26:50.000 on the tundra and I have to bring the rifle because there's grizzly bears uh I'm starving the entire time uh if I
00:26:57.760 want to get warm it requires picking up firewood of which there's not many hauling it back like everything is hard
00:27:04.159 everything is uncomfortable that whole experience for the whole month so then when I get onto the plane that
00:27:10.320 goes from the Arctic back to Las Vegas it's like what do you think my
00:27:15.360 experience of that flight was like pure luxury holy [ __ ] greatest thing that
00:27:20.720 ever happened to me right it's like that chair i had sat in a real chair for more than a month i was like "This is so
00:27:26.240 comfortable." Coffee was hot i'm like "This is the best thing I've ever drank." I had like
00:27:31.919 12 bags of pretzels right the crying baby i'm like "Oh yeah just hand me that baby i got it." Movies in the seat back
00:27:40.159 like it was so boring up there that we were reading the labels on our energy bars and so when you show me Fast and
00:27:47.120 the Furious like 79 it's like this is the greatest thing I've ever seen and
00:27:53.600 then when I go to the bathroom right not only do I not have to take the rifle right that would have been problematic
00:27:59.840 on the plane um but I hit this button in this bathroom this metal thing little
00:28:07.039 red button and hot running water comes out of a faucet and hits my hands i had
00:28:13.760 hot running water on my hands for more than a month and it was just like oh my god now let me let me remind you too
00:28:21.600 that this is happening in a tube of steel that's hurtling through the air at like 600 miles an hour 35,000 ft above
00:28:28.159 sea level and it was one of those moments where I'm like "Holy [ __ ] it is so amazing to be alive today." Like we
00:28:35.520 have the most amazing access to just luxuries and comforts ever and yet we
00:28:43.360 often forget that right so what did it take for me to
00:28:48.640 realize that that flight is a freaking miracle instead of this huge in personal
00:28:55.440 injustice to Michael Easter i had to go out and I had to sort of reset that goalpost and go out into a
00:29:02.399 world that was totally different that was totally challenging that taught me that the world I came from was actually
00:29:07.600 quite great so there's this uh psychologist I believe he's now at Brown
00:29:12.640 when I spoke to him he was just finishing up his PhD at Harvard and he
00:29:17.760 did the study that was published in science i can't remember its title but he basically came up with the theory that's called prevalence induced concept
00:29:23.919 change so what they did in this study is um they took a group of people there was
00:29:31.520 like three different phases of the study but I'm going to talk about two of them because I think they're most relatable what they did is they took a group of
00:29:37.520 800 different people in the first study or I can't remember how many people but they had them look at 800 different
00:29:44.080 faces in a row okay so they'd look at face after face after face and these
00:29:50.240 people had to deem whether these faces were threatening or non-threatening so
00:29:56.960 you're going non-threatening non-threatening oh threatening threatening face after face now at the
00:30:04.159 200th face what they did is they started showing these people fewer threatening faces okay so successively fewer
00:30:13.120 the second study they did it was a similar setup but they use research proposals and these people had to deem whether these research proposals were
00:30:19.360 ethical or unethical same deal about midway through they start feeding these people fewer and
00:30:25.840 fewer unethical proposals now these two scenarios they should be
00:30:30.880 pretty black or white right either you look at a face and it either threatens you or it does not threaten you you read
00:30:36.080 a research proposal and it either crosses this like moral line you have in the sand or it doesn't cross it
00:30:42.320 what they found though is that people basically see gray so as people started
00:30:47.440 encountering fewer truly threatening faces they started judging faces that were on the borderline as threatening so
00:30:53.919 they said threatening just as many times even though the faces weren't truly threatening faces that they would have
00:30:59.760 let slide before same with the research proposals as they get fewer and fewer unethical ones they start to get
00:31:06.960 nitpicky right they're like "Oh well there's that one line in there yeah that's unethical throw it in the pile so
00:31:14.080 the guy calls this prevalence induced his name is David Lavar he calls it prevalence induced concept change and it
00:31:19.120 basically finds that as people experience fewer and fewer problems we don't actually become more satisfied we
00:31:25.440 simply sort of lower our threshold for what we consider a problem so when you apply that to life today to make this
00:31:32.240 practical it's like as the world has become a lot more comfortable as we encounter fewer sort of traumas and real
00:31:40.240 problems in our life we don't necessarily stop and go this is amazing we simply broaden our definition
00:31:48.480 of what a problem is of what a discomfort is and so we end up with the exact same number of problems of
00:31:55.679 discomforts but they've just become progressively more hollow over time i like to think about that as the science
00:32:01.919 of first world problems i think you can think about it as a moving goalpost so it's like you go into one environment
00:32:08.159 and that sort of sets your expectations right and were sort of designed to search for problems more or less
00:32:14.240 designed um designed to search for problems so you're going to find them in your environment
00:32:19.360 no matter how unproatic your environment is sort of objectively unproatic
00:32:24.880 so when I talked to uh Lavari he basically said like yeah I think it makes theoretical sense that if you're
00:32:31.120 going into a place where your problems are more acute and say objectively more
00:32:36.240 realistically problems when you go into this less problematic environment um
00:32:42.880 you'll sort of be like wow this is fantastic now of course over time you're going to adapt back and I found that
00:32:48.960 under myself so when I got back from the Arctic I'm like a I'm like a zen punk
00:32:54.640 man i'm just like nothing's rattling me that was my wife's comment like nothing rattles you since you're back for how
00:33:00.000 long probably a month probably a month then my question becomes well I can't go to the Arctic every month one I can't
00:33:07.360 two nor do I want to so what can I do in my life that sort of constantly pushes
00:33:13.519 that go goalpost back into a place where I'm less neurotic more or less it's almost like we live on a neurotic
00:33:18.799 treadmill in a way as problems fade we just keep searching for problems and finding them
00:33:24.480 so I think there's a lot of things that a person can do like in their daily life and people can get creative around this for example volunteering
00:33:32.240 like if you live a a decent life well why don't you go help people whose lives are a little harder than yours and
00:33:38.799 you'll see what it could be like and what it's like out there and that'll give you some sort of perspective and
00:33:43.919 that's something you can do it takes an hour a week or something right i've talked to people who go to uh recovery
00:33:51.279 meetings including myself uh you go into a meeting and you hear these stories
00:33:57.200 from people who are at the most rock bottom moment of their life like that'll reset what you consider a problem pretty
00:34:04.480 damn fast you just walk out going "Wow I was complaining that uh my tax guy was
00:34:10.000 asking for a lot of papers and this guy just told me a story that just blew my mind." Like that's a real problem and so
00:34:17.520 I think we need to have moments like that that sort of press back against us and put things in a little bit more
00:34:22.960 context and I do think you need the sort of moment where you think about that and
00:34:29.280 you tell yourself the story around that like that's a really important part um and I'm going to this is kind of going
00:34:33.000 No text
00:34:35.199 off on a weird path i don't know what it'll take where it'll take us but we'll find out um when you think about something like a right of passage
00:34:42.879 what people would do in these like these are you know tribes around the world had these different rights of passages all
00:34:49.199 throughout time and this was not like they're all communicating and figuring the same thing no these things arose spontaneous and the point of a right of
00:34:56.320 passage is that we have a person who's at point A in their life and we need them to get and we need to get them to
00:35:01.520 point B where they're going to be more capable more confident more competent
00:35:07.040 we don't just say "Hey you're ready to go to point B." We would often send them out to do something challenging could be
00:35:13.280 like extended time in nature there was all these different things and in that process the person would struggle they
00:35:19.599 would face all these different problems they would have to figure their [ __ ] out and then they would come back and they
00:35:25.920 would be at point B but there was a point where people would sort of gather around and say "What did you learn about
00:35:31.680 that what story are you telling yourself about that?" And so shaping the narrative around a life event becomes
00:35:38.560 critically important I think for mental health and how you frame issues and so
00:35:43.760 if you think of the concept of like event centrality it's like how central
00:35:48.880 is an event going to be to my life and what story am I going to tell around it
00:35:54.160 right so people who tend to take like something bad that happened in their life and they take that in as the
00:35:59.359 central component of their personality tend to have worse mental health whereas
00:36:04.640 people who take it and say hey this thing happened but what can I learn from it how can I grow from it what might
00:36:11.520 happen in the future yes this sucks hard right now but where might it take me in
00:36:17.119 the past or in the future and those two people are going to have completely different trajectories so the narrative
00:36:23.040 you tell yourself becomes really important a few years ago I started keeping a folder where I would look back
00:36:29.359 um to different uh phases of life and just list out sort of the bullet point events of like 0 to 5 and uh you know 5
00:36:36.400 to 10 with with no particular endpoint in mind um it's an exercise that I find
00:36:42.000 very useful because um it offers the opportunity for this kind of like h how
00:36:47.280 do I frame this thing oftentimes that the things that felt the worst at that time turned out to be some of the best
00:36:53.440 things ever and then you can start to create a um a timeline and you realize that most of the things that were felt
00:37:00.720 really bad at the time turned out to be the best thing ever and and that the big wins were almost always the um outgrowth
00:37:07.680 of those prior negative experiences it's just kind of wild but it gets back to this theme that I think is um thread
00:37:14.320 throughout so much of what we're talking about today and and your work which is that it seems like discomfort is uh a
00:37:22.160 prerequisite for really feeling truly good about oneself in the world like I I'm not sure that
00:37:29.280 they can exist um separately from one another but I think we come into the world as these like bubbling babies and
00:37:35.200 like nervous systems prepared to learn and so hopefully the early phase of life
00:37:40.320 is nothing but joy and peace and comfort i mean our parents devote themselves to that we hope right um and then at some
00:37:48.320 point they ought to pull us aside and say hey listen you know the next like 70
00:37:54.160 years are going to be these you know this uh saw of of uh of really tough
00:38:00.160 really great really tough really great experiences but they don't tell us that and I think that most of us go through
00:38:06.240 life trying to get back to this place where we're like where everything's taken care of but what you're what
00:38:12.400 you're saying is that uh that's the exact wrong approach and in fact it's it's it's not um it's not it's not we
00:38:20.640 don't want to be infants but at some level um we we from a comfort
00:38:26.560 perspective we we sort of infantilize ourselves my thought is that the vast
00:38:32.000 majority of things that are good for us today and that help us grow and that help us become better humans they're
00:38:39.200 going to be hard right apply this to exercise exercise sucks right when you're doing exercise it is hard but
00:38:46.240 you're going to get this long-term benefit if you're trying to get your eating in order I can tell you a salad
00:38:52.880 is less delicious than a Dorito and anyone who argues with me you just been eating way too many salads you've
00:38:58.160 diluted yourself right or in my case you know I I'll push back a little bit here because I I love exercise and I love
00:39:04.560 eating clean and what's just happened i got into it early and but and people
00:39:09.680 like this is ridiculous but I just don't eat bad food i quit eating bad food and I stopped thinking about whether or not
00:39:16.000 exercise is a negotiable a long time ago i could see that um I think for probably most people exercise is going to be an
00:39:22.720 uncomfortable event uh it's why what are the federal exercise guidelines 150
00:39:28.880 minutes of uh moderate to vigorous activity a week strength training tries a week something like 18% of Americans
00:39:35.119 actually do that only 18% 18% yeah could be 20 you know fact check me i'll I'll
00:39:42.240 believe you um yeah because it is uncomfortable you know we have all
00:39:47.520 these I think for most people it's uncomfortable uh we have all these sort of internal levers that dissuade extra
00:39:54.800 movement for the sake of it you know when you run your legs are going to burn your leg your lungs are going to hurt um
00:40:01.440 but on the other side of that discomfort is improved health improved mental
00:40:07.119 well-being all these different things um in short I think that sort of to sort of
00:40:12.640 back up from the evolutionary perspective that I often take is that um
00:40:18.160 the reason we have the reason why things are often uncomfortable is because you know we wanted to dissuade extra
00:40:23.520 movement in the past um you didn't want to feel hungry because you needed that food like on and on and on and today the
00:40:30.640 environments have really just flipped where often times doing the uncomfortable thing is the buy into a
00:40:38.079 better life really yeah and you can and it applies to so many different places

00:42:21.359 episode is also brought to us by Matina matina makes loose leaf and ready to drink yerba mate i've often discussed
00:42:27.680 yerba mate's benefits such as regulating blood sugar its high antioxidant content and the ways that it can improve
00:42:33.520 digestion it also may have possible neuroprotective effects it's for those reasons and the fact that Yerba Mate
00:42:39.359 provides in my opinion the most even and steady rise in energy and focus with no crash the Yerba Mate has long been my
00:42:46.319 preferred source of caffeine i also drink Yerba Mate because I love the taste and while there are a lot of different Yerba Mate drinks out there my
00:42:52.720 absolute favorite is Matina i'm excited to share that Matina has recently launched a series of new flavors of
00:42:58.400 their cold brew all zero sugar yerba mate there's a raspberry flavor there's a mango flavor there's a mint flavor
00:43:04.400 there's a lemon flavor and a peach flavor and they are absolutely incredible if I had to pick one that's
00:43:09.599 my absolute favorite it would probably be the mango or the raspberry but frankly I cannot pick just one and I end
00:43:15.920 up having basically one of each every single day again all of these flavors are made with the highest quality
00:43:21.280 ingredients all organic and again all zero sugar if you'd like to try Matina you can go to drinkmatina.com/huberman
00:43:29.359 again that's drinkmatina.com/huberman there's a kid that I've known since he
00:43:33.000 No text
00:43:35.040 was really little um who has some learning challenges uh but managed to get himself into a really fine
00:43:41.119 university um and then after a year took on too many comforts of the social
00:43:47.680 dynamics let's say and decide to leave leave of absence um he read your book um about halfway
00:43:56.480 through the summer where he was working construction and he called me and he said uh I'm going back to to college
00:44:03.760 hell yeah and I I said if he's listening now I applaud him yeah uh he also um
00:44:09.200 quit a heavy cannabis habit in the in the same uh swipe and um and his one of
00:44:16.240 his parents I don't want to give too much information about him because people are are clever these days we'll figure it out uh who he is and I'd like
00:44:22.240 to maintain his anonymity but one of his parents is a first generation immigrant um and when his kid was leaving college
00:44:29.680 was just like "Oh my god." You know he had really toiled in in hopes of his his son not having to have as challenging a
00:44:36.160 physical labor life as he did and so I talked to this kid um just the other night and he's like moving thousands of
00:44:43.359 pounds of concrete every week is really hard on the body and he's in his 20s
00:44:49.359 he's he's saying he goes to bed every night sore like sore from the gym like
00:44:55.920 sore down to the bone and um so I want to extend a thank you
00:45:01.200 from him awesome most people will not hopefully have to
00:45:06.400 go through that process to figure out that the path that they have an opportunity to take um is probably much
00:45:13.040 easier than um the alternative in many cases i want to distinguish between
00:45:20.079 daily self-induced discomforts and these larger discomforts of like going to the Arctic i want to get to the the the
00:45:26.720 massogi theme and and this idea of taking on things that are truly hard that you might not finish but if we were
00:45:31.920 to shrink this down to the the morning you wake up you can scroll on your phone or you can hop in the cold plunge take a
00:45:38.319 cold shower these days there's a lot of um discussion around doing the cold shower has numerous benefits wakes you
00:45:43.599 up dopamine norepinephrine but also it kind of sucks nobody likes cold water if
00:45:49.839 you do send me a note because some you know I'll send you a neurologist's phone
00:45:54.960 number um but we all like the feeling of getting out of it mhm but what are some
00:46:01.440 things besides cold showers and exercise which I do believe everyone should do and get sunlight etc that we can do on a
00:46:08.000 daily basis morning or in the afternoon if we're feeling just kind of low besides cold showers and exercise and
00:46:13.920 sunlight that are hard like is it if I um like I love eating strawberries and I
00:46:19.200 hate putting like I I leave the hulls in weird places without even realizing it and I'll walk by a hole of a strawberry
00:46:25.760 and I'm thinking and I this morning I thought my Easter is going to laugh at me like I'm like I got to pick this thing up i'm not just scattering them
00:46:31.280 around my home by the way but I'm like like what is it like we create these barriers to doing the simplest of things
00:46:37.839 mhm so what are some difficult things that we can introduce to our daily routine that have been shown to make us
00:46:44.079 feel better besides exercise sunlight and cold and cold water yeah so sort of my big picture answer here is my
00:46:52.640 Substack is called the 2% newsletter and I'll tell you why it's called 2% so there's this uh study that found that
00:46:59.119 only 2% of people take the stairs when there's an escalator available 2%
00:47:04.960 now 100% of people know that if they were to take the stairs that would be better for them right they get a better
00:47:10.720 long-term return on their health on their well-being and yet 90% of pe 98%
00:47:16.000 of people do the easier thing that could actually hurt them in the long run in the context of this environment where we
00:47:22.160 don't move enough so this tells me that we're sort of wired to do the next easiest thing but living better in
00:47:30.079 modern life often requires doing these slightly uncomfortable things that are
00:47:35.280 just so obvious and in front of us and it's like you have to get to the second floor
00:47:41.599 so which route are you going to take you going to take the one that's a little bit uncomfortable now but improves your life in the long run or are you going to
00:47:47.040 do the easy thing that might actually hurt you in the long run so that to me is just a metaphor for like how do you
00:47:52.880 improve in daily life right in the trenches of daily life how do you improve so I apply this I try and apply
00:47:59.200 this to as many different areas in my life and I as I can it's like if I can make something just a little bit more
00:48:04.319 uncomfortable i'm not talking about extreme do the slightly harder thing that I know will give me a long-term
00:48:09.920 return I got to take that so for me it's like okay if I'm in my office go through
00:48:16.079 some examples and I have a phone call i could sit here and take the phone call
00:48:21.359 or I could pop in my headphones and I could go for a walk and I could take that call while walking i would say for
00:48:26.559 the vast majority of phone calls unless you're like talking to the CEO your big boss right maybe sit behind the computer
00:48:31.680 for that one but like you're getting in all these steps that are going to be beneficials and steps are one of like
00:48:39.200 the metric that is most correlated to better health like people just need to generally walk more and that's an easy
00:48:45.920 way to do it it's like you got to take the call might as well get some steps in as you do it right things like that
00:48:52.319 things like could you even just carry your groceries at the grocery store you get the basket you're carrying stuff if
00:48:58.720 you're getting in this like low load of carrying that's going to really help with back health strength all these
00:49:04.000 different things even the things as simple as like I'm going to park in the farthest spot away like people go roll
00:49:10.800 their eyes and go that's so obs it's like okay but no one actually does it and if you look at just um nonex
00:49:18.160 exercise activity thermogenesis neat this is basically a a dorky way of saying all the movement in a person's
00:49:24.400 life that isn't dedicated exercise that often outweighs the benefits of exercise
00:49:30.800 in many studies certainly by calories burned certainly by calories burned also
00:49:36.800 uh some data suggests even health outcomes in the long run um there's some Mayo Clinic data that says that you know
00:49:43.040 people who just move around a lot more in their daily life they're burning like 800 calories just from moving around this incidental movement it's like
00:49:49.760 running eight miles or something if you do some really rough back of hand math right and so I think looking for those
00:49:55.839 opportunities even beyond exercise something like um so in the comfort crisis I write about the value of
00:50:02.319 silence for example um we have increased the world's loudness four-fold as human
00:50:08.880 beings and yet silence is actually pretty good for us in this context of noise so you
00:50:14.480 put someone in silence and like yeah it's a little uncomfortable at first people will generally report being like it's so quiet this is weird a little
00:50:21.520 weirded out but as time goes on people tend to calm down it's sort of like a
00:50:26.559 nice reset and so can you even go hey like I go into my office and I just start blasting music immediately like
00:50:31.599 most people keep the TV on who keep the TV on all day it's not that they're watching it it's that they just need
00:50:37.200 noise in the background or else they feel weird but if you can sort of cut that out even though it's a little bit hard at first it's probably going to
00:50:43.040 improve you over the long run like how can we apply this to different areas i did a post it's called the 2% manifesto
00:50:50.319 on my Substack so I'll link to it um in that link I mentioned um and it lists a bunch of different ways but I think it
00:50:55.839 really is it's just like this mindset shift like how can I take this thing I have to do and maybe make it a little bit harder and get a benefit and once
00:51:02.720 you start to stack those things up like things start moving things start changing yeah I agree i um you know my
00:51:09.920 trivial example about the strawberry hulls which I always put like next to the bowl of strawberries and they'll
00:51:15.040 just sit there um this is actually really beneficial for me cuz I do that too and my wife and my wife goes "What
00:51:21.119 kind of psychopath does this?" I be like "Well there's two of us now." Uh at least two of us um if you are a
00:51:28.160 Strawberry Hull um a non uh throwawayer um definitely put put a comment and
00:51:34.480 we'll we'll start a support group um it taught me an important lesson though
00:51:39.599 because um it's less about the strawberry holes um than noticing the
00:51:46.079 feeling of resistance like what is that and and then recognizing how trivial that resistance is but how um pervasive
00:51:53.200 it is so like the things that we resist doing like I've got the making the bed first thing in the morning down i've got
00:51:59.920 the morning sunlight thing down i've got got all that stuff down but it's the little things that we can get away with
00:52:06.640 not doing for a while that I think are the the ones that really erode this whatever this um circuit in our brain is
00:52:14.079 that that you're talking about and and I I do want to talk about brain circuitry a little bit um but I don't think we
00:52:20.079 have a name for it and um yeah because it's it's it's a little bit of willpower it's a little bit of tenacity it's a bit
00:52:26.240 of reflection but what I what I'm getting to here forgive me because I'm
00:52:31.680 stumbling through this a little bit because it's it's something I'm just arriving to in this conversation is that there's something about the contrast
00:52:38.640 between prior experience and current experience where we could say level of discomfort from you know 1 to 10 um the
00:52:46.800 more uncomfortable something is in our prior experience the better the next phase of life is going to feel whether
00:52:53.200 or not it's hours or days later as you said a month you go to the Arctic for how long were you there 33 days so more
00:52:59.520 than a month and you got a month of zened out bliss uh you know super
00:53:04.960 Michael to you and to everybody else right and then the crazies start to slowly work their way back in starts to
00:53:11.119 work its way back in and I think that it's a um this is a microcosm for a lot of things about nervous systems they
00:53:18.240 adapt and and so forth so when I think about the examples you gave and I love the one of taking the stairs i always
00:53:23.920 think when I travel I'm going to sit a lot i I don't like to sit too much i always feel better when I've moved a lot so I'm farmer carrying my luggage of big
00:53:32.079 supplement bag you know hence the secondary screening and uh the you know security and then the stairs are a great
00:53:38.720 opportunity so we can reframe right as humans we can reframe tell oursel that things are good for us um but it's these
00:53:45.680 areas where we where we experience a lot of resistance to ourselves I think that are the most challenging as opposed to
00:53:50.800 resistance to the world as you point out the the world isn't um lacking opportunities to to walk on a call or
00:53:58.240 take the stairs it's all around us but it's that internal kind of like you know
00:54:03.280 shift towards what's more comfortable what do you think about the the more psychological things like um like god
00:54:05.000 No text
00:54:10.000 forbid reading a book in paper form as opposed to listening to it and I love audiobooks but you know forcing oneself
00:54:16.240 to read um having the phone out of the room um read something difficult like a
00:54:22.720 hard book like if I want a really good hard book I ask Mark Andre for a book recommendation usually I have to go find
00:54:28.800 the book from a like a special book seller because some of these books are hard to find and then I open up the first page and I go "Well I knew he was
00:54:35.839 really smart he's one of the smartest people I've ever met i've met a lot of smart people but this is really challenging." And then I have to just
00:54:41.680 start lathing through it and lathing through it and it reminds me of being a PhD student and learning about the nervous system for the first time that
00:54:47.760 stuff feels so good when we like find a nugget of of understanding
00:54:53.839 but and get through it and get through it but um so in the in the cognitive domain in the
00:55:00.880 emotional domain like do you intentionally sit down with your wife and go let's have like a really hard conversation so that we can have a
00:55:06.559 really great weekend do you do that do you do this in all areas of your life um well I'm definitely not perfect my wife
00:55:12.800 and I actually we go on very long walks and that's where all the magic happens there's something about walking as a
00:55:18.880 couple we'll do like 12 miles on a Saturday 8 to 12 miles on a Saturday those are long walks yeah and you got
00:55:24.079 like four hours together and you know the first hour you're just kind of this and that and you know how was your work week it was good how was yours and then
00:55:31.200 like by hour two you're getting into like the deep and the gritty stuff and I think there's something about Forward
00:55:37.839 Ambulation uh with other people that is really um lifegiving and there's
00:55:44.400 something even sort of spiritual about it and the amount of connection that you can get from people so that's something that we definitely do and I don't think
00:55:50.319 those conversations would come if we were like let's sit on the couch okay we'll turn on this Netflix show hey how
00:55:56.400 are you like [ __ ] just wouldn't happen right yeah the walk's a little bit harder of course um but magic happens
00:56:03.680 there i would also say there's a there's a section in the comfort crisis and I've written about this a little bit
00:56:09.760 in my other book scarcy brain as well where I talk about the value of boredom so boredom is effectively this
00:56:16.559 evolutionary discomfort that tells us go do something else it's neither good it's
00:56:22.160 neither bad simply tells us whatever you're doing right now the return on your time invested is running thin go do
00:56:28.720 something else so in the past if you think of us say um we're out foraging
00:56:35.200 for food and we're in this one area and we can't find anything there's nothing
00:56:40.960 boredom would kick in because we're not getting a return and it would say "Well go do something else." And we'd probably go say "Okay well what if we try fishing
00:56:47.119 this river or something right?" And I think what happens in modern life is that when that evolutionary
00:56:53.359 discomfort that tells us to go do something else kicks in that something else is just like really easy effortless
00:56:59.280 escape and it's in the form of a cell phone it's Instagram it's whatever right it's like this hyper stimulating content
00:57:08.000 but I think that sort of sitting with boredom and leveraging it to see where else it might take you beyond a screen
00:57:14.640 can be really valuable yes it's uncomfortable um but I've found I've get
00:57:20.400 my best ideas and I think that there's de centuries of thinkers who would say
00:57:27.839 the same like my best ideas come when I've sort of removed myself from outside stimulation and yes like my mind wanders
00:57:34.559 I'm bored but then bam some magic happens one point of messaging around
00:57:40.079 screens today that I wanted to touch on too is that like there's so much
00:57:45.119 media around cell phones and like you got to use your cell phone less here's a million different ways to use your cell
00:57:51.200 phone yet less yes that's important yes we should all do it but I think it misses a big point and that is if we
00:57:59.200 take let's say two hours off our phone screen time what happens is that people often get bored and they go [ __ ] what am
00:58:06.240 I going to do and then they turn on Netflix not much different right it's not an
00:58:12.640 algorithm no but you're still just like taking this information that is being beamed into you rather than seeing what
00:58:18.720 else the world can offer you and sort of coming up with your own ideas and creativity so I like to say rather than
00:58:24.480 focusing on um less phone I like to think more boredom get yourself in a space where like boredom is going to
00:58:30.559 kick on it's going to be uncomfortable your mind's going to wander and you might find some good ideas yeah you'll have some weird stuff in your brain of
00:58:36.240 course that's what happens when your mind wanders but I think you can find some interesting things out there does
00:58:41.760 boredom include reflection or it's true boredom like uh I think we need to be
00:58:47.280 removed from the hyper stimulating stuff that we often when we get that moment of
00:58:53.040 I've got nothing to do like stand in a grocery line right what do people do
00:58:58.400 everyone's on their cell phone like we can't just like sit with our thoughts for more than three seconds so I think
00:59:03.760 even just having the moment where you go okay going to do nothing might get a little
00:59:09.040 weird might get a little uncomfortable might be a tiny bit bored but like your mind's going to go some interesting places I think can be productive in the
00:59:15.680 context of today what I'm chuckling because what were your thoughts on the the brief um appearance of the the raw
00:59:22.880 dog flight experience that showed up last year did you see that where guys were posting online it did seem to be
00:59:28.480 guys um saying that they quote unquote raw dogged a terrible use of language um
00:59:34.960 I didn't pick it uh they would do a 10-hour flight or a six-hour flight with
00:59:40.400 no media just sit there as a as a kind of sign of their toughness i thought it
00:59:46.960 was kind of interesting uh here's what here's what came out of that is my wife said "The hell these guys are weak."
00:59:55.040 She's been doing that ever since I knew her she literally sits in that seat and she turns on the flight screen map and
01:00:01.680 she just zones into that i'm like "You're a crazy person." Now it turns out she's just like the original raw
01:00:07.920 dogger i love it that was not the answer I expected um yeah that that trend kind of
01:00:13.920 came and went yeah came and went i think that you know and there's the there's a performative element to that right and
01:00:19.920 so it was kind of became a performance for the for the algorithms and whatever where it's I think maybe we need to get
01:00:26.640 a little more nuance behind that and put some thought into it it's like how it's like okay if I'm not on my screen like
01:00:31.680 how am I going to use this time can I use it to go sort of deeper into my thoughts and
01:00:37.760 you know I do think people need time especially when you're deal trying to chew off big ideas like I've found that
01:00:45.119 a long walk where I don't take my cell phone it's like I need that and I think a lot of people I think there's a lot of
01:00:50.960 anecdotes historically that um good ideas come from these moments where you're just that's all you're focused on
01:00:57.200 maybe you're on a walk you're just kind of sitting and just peeling away the layers
01:01:02.640 not easy but worthwhile you know throughout history and still
01:01:07.680 now many people get ideas um from dreams during nighttime sleep or during the
01:01:13.440 kind of liinal states between waking and and sleep these times of of inactivity
01:01:19.200 that no sensory input coming in are are when the brain processes things and it makes perfect sense to me that in
01:01:25.200 daydreaming or in boredom as you describe it that new ideas would would
01:01:30.960 surface just as they would from the liinal state between sleep and awake yeah and I think people sometimes
01:01:36.079 experience this like there's a reason we have that sort of cliche that's like you come up with your best ideas in the shower because there's not this
01:01:42.880 simulation right just kind of Yeah you're not on your phone you're removed from you're removed from the noise and you're just kind of oh bam but you got
01:01:49.040 to write them down too i found that as well if you have a good idea yeah what's your idea capture mechanism
01:01:53.000 No text
01:01:56.240 you write yeah I usually have a notebook on me just write things down and much like a nighttime dream where we wake up
01:02:03.119 and like "Oh I'm going to remember this tomorrow." And then you you won't remember you won't remember i agree it's
01:02:08.240 important to write things down during the day that come to mind actually it was the great Joe Strummer of the Clash of Mascalo's fame who there's some clip
01:02:15.680 of him someplace saying in that like heavy like breath voice where he's like "You if you have an idea you have to
01:02:20.960 write it down." Yeah because not only will you forget but even if you happen
01:02:26.319 to remember it you can't capture the essence of the the the inspiration unless you write it down at that moment
01:02:32.000 he really believed that in that moment it carried a certain um uh a certain
01:02:37.200 value that you couldn't replace just by writing it down later yeah I agree so I just did for a third book I'm working on
01:02:43.599 I did this um it was about 40 days this is a hike through southern Utah and it goes into through the Grand Canyon so
01:02:49.599 into northern Arizona and then ends in Zion took about 40 days and so normally
01:02:54.880 when I'm reporting a book like when I did the comfort crisis when I did scarcity brain like I'm traveling I'm doing all this stuff but I'm usually
01:03:00.640 writing using these notebooks use a very particular notebook to write in the rain because I'm in outdoor environments
01:03:06.960 whatever but on this hike like I can't cover the mileage we need to cover all
01:03:12.559 day if I'm constantly stopping and writing and like I can't hike and try and write it was Yeah thorough had an
01:03:18.799 advantage by just staying in the one spot yeah exactly exactly so I took voice notes actually on my phone and um
01:03:25.039 I found that to be really useful too that some a tool that people can use so I had when I got back from the hike I
01:03:31.200 had like 500 different voice notes some of them were 10 seconds some of them were six minutes of me just babbling but
01:03:39.119 there's some good stuff in there and um so I think you do need to capture it in the moment because I did find too that I
01:03:45.359 didn't really catch on to the voice note idea until maybe the second or third fourth day of the hike and I would like
01:03:53.039 I can't stop and write this down and then I'd be in camp at night we'd set up and I'd go and I'd start writing down
01:03:58.720 the day's notes and I'd go "What was that thought you had in that canyon it
01:04:04.079 was so good." And I'd just never find it right so I just was like "Okay we got to use the voice notes tool and just take
01:04:09.680 those." It was great uh there's a very very uh accomplished neurobiologist out
01:04:15.760 at Caltech by the name of David Anderson and he's done some really interesting work on these more ancient brain areas
01:04:20.799 like the hypothalamus primitive states like aggression mating behavior but uh it carries out to a number of things
01:04:27.200 that we're talking about now um about cognitive states and creativity and capturing ideas and it's this notion of
01:04:33.440 attractor states that basically that the brain uh much to most people's dismay
01:04:38.960 doesn't work such that you go oh I'm going to from 9 to 11 or I'll do some hard coding or I'm going to and you sit
01:04:44.799 down and you start no you you you warm up you kind of ratchet into it and then
01:04:50.720 um but over time it's it's almost like a ball bearing on a flat surface and then and then the surface starts becoming
01:04:56.000 more and more concave and eventually it's a deep trench and then that's usually when the buzzer goes off it's time to move to something else but those
01:05:01.760 so these attractor states are basically the the shutting down of of a lot of other circuitry as one circuit kind of
01:05:08.400 ramps up its activity but that over time um we can entrain these things we can
01:05:13.920 link them to specific uh events in time like the making of your coffee at 9:00 a.m so your nervous system unconsciously
01:05:20.240 starts to predict the attractor state of being in a state of deep focus and writing uh that all starts to make sense
01:05:26.319 it starts to just it's a different kind of lens on habit um but if you look at
01:05:32.079 most people including my own activity through the lens of attractor states and you say well what am I training my brain
01:05:38.880 for what am I in training end training end training e N and then also just drop
01:05:44.079 the EN what am I what am I teaching my brain to do on a daily basis you go well the attractor state is scrolling lots
01:05:50.960 and lots and lots and lots of media it's reading people's comments this is funny it's talking to friends it's texting a
01:05:56.640 few people and what we what we've done I think is that we've created these attractor states of it's not that we're
01:06:02.000 we all have ADHD or something some people do but we've we're right where we belong given our pri our prior behavior
01:06:09.039 we're just we're just training up this this trench of a bunch of noise and then
01:06:14.799 the the end of the day comes and you're like [ __ ] I didn't get anything done this kind of thing so when you describe getting out into nature and removing all
01:06:22.000 of that and and kind of forcing yourself to uh to go in a particular not just
01:06:29.440 physical direction but um to go in a particular mental direction um I feel like it's getting back to something very
01:06:36.000 fundamental it's like uh it's like the overload principle of resistance training or cardiovascular exercise and
01:06:42.799 increasing stroke volume it's like the it's like the fundamentals of how the mind work which is one of the reasons I
01:06:47.839 I love these practices so much which brings me back to this question of okay so there's the 2% rule yep taking the
01:06:50.000 No text
01:06:55.839 identity that I'm going to be this 2% of people that's going to do this harder thing it's going to be harder in the short term but it's going to give me
01:07:01.520 this long-term benefit and if I can find areas to apply that in my life I'm going to get this big long like the benefits
01:07:08.319 just pile up massively and then at the other end of the spectrum is the misogi
01:07:13.440 concept could you explain misogi yeah um so if I were to sort of give the cliff
01:07:18.720 notes I'll give the cliff notes and then the longer explanation in cliffnotes is that msogi is sort of almost a modern
01:07:24.160 right of passage in order to teach people what they're capable of and to give them experience that really changes
01:07:31.200 them thereafter now I heard about this idea um from a
01:07:36.319 guy whose name is Marcus Elliot and he came up with this idea back in the 90s it was like this personal thing he did
01:07:41.520 and I stumbled upon it um Marcus I believe got his MD from Harvard and he
01:07:46.559 decides like I don't want to be a doctor i want to get into sports science so he runs this facility that's called P3
01:07:52.160 they're actually not far from here they're up in Santa Barbara and he works with all these different sort of athletes he's got contracts with the NBA
01:07:59.039 with the NFL blah blah blah whatever but he also sort of realizes that um what
01:08:06.640 really changes a person it can't always be measured because he's taking a lot of um movement measuring he does a lot of
01:08:13.039 like big data AI stuff around movement measurement can predict injury and things like that um he realizes that
01:08:19.040 like these big changes that force a player to be better that
01:08:24.479 get them in a better state when a sort of game is on the line that can't be measured and he does this practice he
01:08:30.399 calls msogi and the idea is that once a year you're going to go out and you're going to do something really really hard
01:08:37.679 now he defines really hard as saying you should have a 50-50 shot at completing whatever your masogi task is so 50-50
01:08:45.600 shot because today I think he's right here he argues like even when we take on a challenge we have to know we're going
01:08:51.600 to complete it right it's like people don't run marathons and go I don't know if I'm going to finish the marathon they
01:08:57.040 say I don't know if I'm going to finish the marathon and sort of insert some arbitrary time um so that's the
01:09:02.960 challenge element and then the second rule of Msokei is that you can't die right so the implication is yeah do
01:09:08.960 something pretty hard and what tends to happen when you go out and you do
01:09:14.000 something really sort of kooky challenging that you know is really going to be hard for you that you are
01:09:19.520 truly unsure if you're going to be able to finish this is you get into this moment and in this moment you think
01:09:26.640 you've hit your edge you know I've hit my edge like I'm not going to be able to finish this thing like all is lost but
01:09:33.679 if you can kind of just keep going one foot in front of the other you get this other moment and that's where you look
01:09:39.359 back and you go "Well wait a minute i thought my edge was back there but I am
01:09:45.359 clearly past it right now so I've sold myself short here." And then the question is okay if I've sold myself
01:09:52.319 short here in this moment where else in my life might I be selling myself short
01:09:57.760 and that's where the big changes happen right that's the question that you want to leave with from the maseogi now in
01:10:04.080 the past I would argue so after I meet Marcus he tells me about this like quirky masogi idea he does he does all
01:10:09.199 kinds of weird stuff um I started sort of really doing some digging and going "All right this is
01:10:15.440 like a interesting idea it's also sort of wacky you know but if you look back in history I think we had things like
01:10:22.640 this in the form of rights of passage." And like I mentioned before like rights of passage just popped up naturally in
01:10:29.199 all these different cultures but there was a realization that doing something that truly thrust you beyond the bounds
01:10:35.520 of what you thought you were capable of where you had to figure things out where
01:10:40.880 you had to really doubt yourself and where you had to overcome becomes this sort of great teacher for the human
01:10:47.199 spirit so that's the idea of masogi go out do something that you think is going to be really really hard see what you
01:10:54.159 learn and even if you fail that's fine you're still going to learn something
01:10:59.280 along the path i'm a huge fan of this misogi concept um so once a year picking
01:11:05.920 site could be physical could be physical could be intellectual create creative
01:11:11.679 could be anything and how important is it you think to um
01:11:18.000 advertise that you're doing this versus uh important to keep it quiet and to
01:11:23.760 yourself i think it's better to keep it to yourself so I think we live in a
01:11:28.960 world where nowadays people do a lot of things um for external reasons to get likes on social media so your neighbor
01:11:36.400 will be like "Oh that guy's the badass in the neighborhood that lady did this." Whatever and I think if you can just do
01:11:42.880 something only for you um that makes it sort of more valuable it puts a sort of
01:11:48.640 different spin on it um once you decide oh I'm going to do this thing because oh
01:11:54.800 this guy did it in an hour well I'm going to do it in 59 minutes that also get puts a ceiling on you right because
01:12:01.760 now you're going to shoot for 59 minutes rather than well what if you just went out and did this for yourself and you
01:12:06.800 just went all in potentially you could do it in 55 you know um and I think
01:12:12.560 today we do live in a world where there's a lot of um sharing in order to get social approval um you know you can
01:12:20.000 go back and forth about what are the goods and the bads of that um but I would just argue that sometimes it's good to do things only for yourself and
01:12:27.360 use that as the sort of lever that you know you have that maybe no one else
01:12:32.960 knows you have it but you can pull that damn thing when you need to and that's going to really affect some change i
01:12:38.719 mean one of my big like my one of my biggest messages is like people just need to go out and find some
01:12:45.440 damn adventure and it's very easy to get locked in a cycle of doing the same thing over and over you exist at home
01:12:53.440 and everything is nice and comfortable and like stresses come in but they're like in the form of emails and deadlines
01:13:00.560 and things just get predictable go out into a place that is totally
01:13:05.920 unfamiliar do something that's going to be challenging to you go with the wind
01:13:11.600 you will find things that will really enhance your life that will make you feel as Joseph Campbell put it the
01:13:18.640 rapture of being alive like I can tell you I feel most alive when it's like "Okay I got to go out to wherever it is
01:13:26.640 the Bolivian jungle and I got to figure this thing out because I'm going down there to meet with this Chimane tribe or
01:13:32.719 whatever it is or I got to go to Iraq and investigate the drug trade." Doesn't have to be that extreme of course but
01:13:37.920 that is where I absolutely feel that I am most alive it's like we're going into this unknown world we don't know what's
01:13:44.000 going to happen we're going to encounter all these wacky characters along the way there's going to be trials there's going to be hardships but I'm going to like
01:13:51.280 get through it and I'm going to have to figure things out and it is just like so life-giving it's like the most amazing
01:13:57.440 thing and I come back from that and it's taught me something that allows me to function better when I get back to my
01:14:03.679 normal life because I've learned all these skills and tools that I wouldn't have gotten had I not exited normal life
01:14:08.880 and gone out and just had an adventure what if you and I were to um run an
01:14:12.000 No text
01:14:14.320 online experiment this is actually serious here where we said "Okay uh we are going to have you and I and a bunch
01:14:22.320 of people that are going to join us are going to uh refrain from any any
01:14:27.440 smartphone use for a certain number of hours per day and instead of posting your sleep score uh which a lot of
01:14:32.480 people are now doing you're going to post the number of hours that you manage to be offline completely at the end of the day so we're going to compete for
01:14:38.960 time away from social media and maybe we even get on Instagram live once a week
01:14:44.239 and we we share our experiences and there's this club of wackos that want to do this right for and and and see where
01:14:51.040 we get with it do you think that the sharing of that experience at the end and the community around it would
01:14:56.400 actually detract from the experience uh when people are away from their phones
01:15:02.000 it's a good question i think it's one of those complicated things where there would probably be some upsides to the sharing some people need the like sort
01:15:08.400 of community element like yeah that would probably enhance in some ways um the community element and the
01:15:14.719 competition might also bend people's behavior in a way that maybe they
01:15:19.760 wouldn't have behaved had they not known that they were part of this group right so I think these questions get really
01:15:25.520 complicated and I think it's also there's probably some individual variation um like I know that I
01:15:31.440 personally do a lot better um if I don't have like
01:15:38.400 a huge social element to things like I don't run marathons just because I'm like for me psychologically I know
01:15:45.040 marathons give people a lot of value because there's community and all these things but like in my mind for some
01:15:50.400 reason I got this weird quirk where I go yeah but I could just go run like 26 miles like at any time on my own time
01:15:57.199 and not have to wear this bib and like pay this entry fee like you could just run 26 miles you know so like something
01:16:04.159 they don't do it for me um but they do it for some people so I think you would have I think you'd have individual
01:16:10.000 differences what do you think i think we should do the experiment i think we should um I think it'd be a lot of fun
01:16:15.199 to get a group of people large group of people together um from online to go
01:16:20.960 into their lives and then create a community of people that use social media for learning and for actual social
01:16:26.719 connection yeah but are not leaning on it for um this kind of uh
01:16:33.120 people call fast food or kind of what my dad would call the kind of chewing gum version of of of nutrition um all day
01:16:39.360 long yeah and I say this as somebody that enjoys social media so um but I think this is an idea I wanted to pitch
01:16:45.199 to you today so decided to do it on mic i have a good platform for it unless you do how we could track it so one of my
01:16:52.400 favorite apps it's called Clearpace what Clear Space does is it uh when you
01:16:59.120 go to you select the apps that you want to sort of quote unquote block um when
01:17:04.480 you go to select one of those apps let's say it's Instagram it gives you a nice quote like a
01:17:10.239 inspiring quote about life but you have to wait right there's like a 10-second pause you wait and then it takes you to
01:17:17.440 the next screen and it says "How much time do you actually want to spend on this app?" And you can select you know 5
01:17:23.840 minutes 10 minutes 15 20 minutes and then you select whatever amount of time and only once you've gone through that process can you use the app for the
01:17:31.120 pre-selected amount of time and I found it to be really useful because it gets
01:17:36.159 me intentional right a lot of times people just pull out their phone they immediately hit oh Instagram and then
01:17:41.600 you find yourself in it and then you you went in to answer a DM but like actually you watched dog videos nothing wrong
01:17:47.280 with dog videos but you watched dog videos for 30 minutes and you go oh [ __ ] I've just lost my day right so this thing sort of interrupts that and they
01:17:54.239 do have um some challenge features they could probably create us a group that would be really fun it sounds really
01:17:59.360 cool yeah I I I love social media i think that in its essence um it's an
01:18:05.280 opportunity to really connect with people and I've always wanted to have like a weekly meeting with my followers
01:18:10.880 where we I could learn from them and hear what they're doing and what they're up to and you know and um and so I feel
01:18:17.040 like there's real value to that like going and living one's life and then meeting online and talking to people you
01:18:23.040 otherwise wouldn't be able to share information and and learn from them and and hopefully them from you and and to
01:18:29.520 to really do that i don't know are there any aside from perhaps 12step or maybe
01:18:35.840 there's some religious groups um but are there any within social media platform groups that
01:18:42.560 meet regularly and have for years like we meet once a week we get on there we have a live I mean I'll pop on for a
01:18:48.719 live every once in a while um to connect with my audience um and mostly to hear their questions but I wonder if there
01:18:55.360 are any online groups that have met consistently for for many years that's a great question it reminds me of that um
01:19:02.800 you probably saw the story about the the guys and this wasn't social media but it's amazing that group of guys that's been playing a game of tag for like 40
01:19:09.920 years or something really did you see that story yeah it's like these guys I think they were like kids and they kept up this like lifelong game of tag and it
01:19:18.719 just never it's never ended at weddings and everything oh wow most people
01:19:24.000 probably think that's got to be incredibly obnoxious so they never pause the game never pause the game yeah and
01:19:29.520 it'll you know someone might be it for like years and then that person will take a secret flight to Cleveland or
01:19:35.600 wherever the other guy is and then gotcha you're it you know this is still going i think it's still going yeah
01:19:41.760 amazing amazing great yeah you know I' I've said this before many times on social media but uh any dopamine reward
01:19:50.000 that is not preceded by substantial effort you know can potentially destroy us in the form of addiction but also
01:19:55.840 leads to a drop in that baseline of dopamine at other times this is you know this is the abundance of food the ease
01:20:02.640 of life that you're referring to um in this experiment that I'm hoping we we can run in some form or another the the
01:20:09.120 idea is that there will be some resistance um to stepping away from smartphone
01:20:16.320 uh there will be great hopefully pleasure and the attractor states will take over to doing other things in one's
01:20:22.239 life relationships and creative pursuits etc when we're away from the phone but that there's a certain amount of effort
01:20:28.320 to to resist so that when we come together socially it it's a real
01:20:34.560 dopamine not hit but it's a real dopamine rise that doesn't drop the baseline of dopamine so it meets all the
01:20:40.159 the kind of criteria of of uh dopamine dynamics that I believe are healthy because we really can distinguish
01:20:45.920 healthy from unhealthy dopamine dynamics but it still incorporates the smartphone
01:20:51.120 which doesn't look like it's going anywhere um so it'd be fun to do this experiment i don't know i think it's
01:20:56.159 like that yeah to your point smartphones are here to stay clearly benefits to social media else no one would use it um
01:21:04.000 problem is some of the benefits come with long-term harms right um but I
01:21:09.360 think if you can sort of train yourself to use it in a way that helps you rather than hurt you well that's a good thing
01:21:15.440 sort of reminded me of this story um of my mom so my mom had cancer about 10
01:21:21.280 years ago she's fine now um but she was in for one of her annual checkups right
01:21:27.120 and this is obviously nerve-wracking because you're finding out hey did it come back whatever blah blah blah so she
01:21:34.239 goes to this meeting and I was um I was out of town she goes to this appointment and she's in the doctor's office she's
01:21:39.760 in the sort of waiting room in the gown and they're like "Yeah we'll be back in a minute." And so she sitting there and
01:21:46.080 right as the nurse left she immediately went to put out pull grab her phone and she left her phone in her car and
01:21:53.600 she's like I realized in that moment I was grabbing that phone because I was
01:21:59.840 anxious and emotionally vulnerable and that was effectively a sedative in that
01:22:05.520 moment and I had to sit with that i had just had to sit and feel that she's like
01:22:11.840 but by being sort of forced into that moment it made me realize well why don't
01:22:18.480 I want to feel this and that leads to these questions like oh because I value being alive well why do I value being
01:22:23.600 alive we'll hear all these reasons oh I appreciate this thing i appreciate this other thing and that insight I think
01:22:31.920 taught her a lot about how she wants to spend her time too and so having these moments where we don't immediately go
01:22:38.239 for the sort of easy uncomfortable or easy comfortable thing I think can lead
01:22:44.159 to these insights and that's just like this very micro moment but that it it
01:22:50.159 stands for so much and her behavior did change afterwards you know she's she's awesome she's
01:22:56.880 always been amazing she's a um she's a single mom and I'm an only child and um
01:23:02.560 she's been sober for 40 years yes 40 years and I'm 38 so she got sober had a
01:23:10.320 kid um cards were definitely stacked against us but she worked her ass off
01:23:15.360 and built us a pretty good life that's awesome definitely weren't rich but just amazing woman and um yeah I've learned a
01:23:21.679 lot from her she sounds like an amazing woman i'm really happy to hear she's healthy
01:23:23.000 No text
01:23:27.199 and that moment of um having left the phone in the car uh yet it's amazing how
01:23:35.280 those small portals in time like can open up so much i I I think um social
01:23:42.800 media offers a lot i do also think that as your example points out it offers the
01:23:48.639 opportunity to numb out or to experience drama and I feel like
01:23:54.719 when people talk about the dopamine hits of social media the data on this just don't square with the idea that that
01:24:02.239 scrolling our phone gives us dopamine hits it gives us low-level expenditure
01:24:08.000 um you know I want to you on the basis of your books I I wrote something down a
01:24:14.080 couple days ago i was thinking about our conversation i was thinking I I've long believed that you know dopamine is a
01:24:20.320 currency we it's the universal currency of motivation right it's what literally
01:24:26.800 allows us to ambulate forward it controls movement in the body that's why people with Parkinson's who lose dopamine neurons can't move but in terms
01:24:33.199 of mental movement is motivation like movement towards something redirecting our efforts and so forth um and I was
01:24:39.760 thinking about um this idea that we we can either
01:24:45.360 spend our dopamine right or we can invest our dopamine on this is purely on
01:24:50.800 the basis of your work awesome um and it seems like all day long we we can
01:24:56.080 potentially spend dopamine scrolling is spending and and it's the kind of spending we don't even notice that we're doing we're sort of leaking it's almost
01:25:02.400 like leaking dopamine we we we're not getting these big quoteunquote dopamine hits this is why I don't like the
01:25:07.520 dopamine hit model i don't log on Instagram and go like wow like it's it's no like it's not like coming back from a
01:25:13.840 massochi and going I lived it's not transformative for the next month it keeps you in the in the rut of looking
01:25:21.120 for more because it's like mental chewing gum as my my dad long time ago he said be careful of of the internet uh
01:25:28.159 I said why and he said it's just mental chewing gum you just wise wise guy yeah and um he's he's very reg regimented guy
01:25:34.960 um and so we're always spending but then there are these things that require
01:25:40.719 effort that are in we're still spending dopamine while we're doing it like if
01:25:46.000 you go do a workout you're spending effort to do it but you get something back on that investment so you're
01:25:51.840 investing it you're not just spending it and that's great and the other one based on what you told me today is reflection
01:26:00.880 in states of boredom or meditation or you know for for people that orient this
01:26:06.400 way prayer what whatever it happens to be or maybe it's even just leaving a social gathering and keeping your phone
01:26:12.400 in your pocket and walking back to the car and just really thinking about the richness of that interaction right these little things that are disappearing in
01:26:18.800 in in our lives these days but that are so easy to recapture that reflection is another way of investing our dopamine i
01:26:25.600 think what when we look at the the neurobiological literature on dopamine we're going to realize that yeah of
01:26:31.440 course addictions spend out your dopamine drop your baseline your your
01:26:36.560 bank account is in the red deep in the red yeah um it's a whole other
01:26:42.400 discussion but that most of us are spending and then we reset each night with sleep and then we spend the next day and then we reset and it's a life of
01:26:49.600 it becomes kind of a meaningless life and um this isn't to demonize the social media platforms that they're pretty good
01:26:56.000 at letting us numb out when we don't want to feel something or feel drama when we need to feel that like lift um
01:27:01.840 like oh my god she did that he did that oh my god the lawsuit got dismissed about these two people who are arguing
01:27:07.920 about who said what and who did i'm like how boring is it really and how
01:27:13.600 unimportant is it but it's not boring because they they've taught us how to make it not boring and you look at the
01:27:19.600 comments it's like it's just like gross it's like high school forever but the worst part of high school it effectively
01:27:25.360 trains us to use it so when I think about comfort crisis or scarcity brain see it's really about how to invest your
01:27:31.360 dopamine in effort and reflection as a way to capture more of capability to
01:27:37.679 lean into things that that's that's really um to me what I like is the the genius of of doing hard things that you
01:27:44.800 brought forward in the comfort crisis i as as I started today's discussion saying I mean it really changed my
01:27:51.280 everyday because I think so so intensely now about like the like how can I introduce more pain to in to bring about
01:27:58.560 more meaning as opposed to comfort like meaning and in any in any case so um
01:28:06.320 yeah I I think you're you're really on to the two things that matter most which are effort and and reflection i love
01:28:13.280 that language of spending versus investing that's just Yeah I think you hit the nail on the head there and the
01:28:20.320 the investing is usually things that are going to be a little more challenging
01:28:25.520 not as hyper stimulating things you maybe wouldn't necessarily want to do at first and then once you've done them
01:28:31.520 enough you realize oh this has really changed me in a fundamental and positive way and hopefully you start to sort of
01:28:37.520 crave them like you said no I love exercise right that's where we want people to get with all sorts of things that can enhance their life and I think
01:28:44.639 too I'll add here is so if you think about people who pile up money and pile up
01:28:51.040 money and invest and invest and invest and they never spend it maybe you also need to learn okay now
01:28:57.280 that I'm doing all this investing it's also okay to spend it sometimes right and then I can really enjoy that
01:29:03.199 because I've done all these things and so like I find with my with my own use I
01:29:08.239 used to sort of um beat myself up if I was on say Instagram or whatever just
01:29:13.440 looking at nonsense i I like nonsense on Instagram and I would beat myself up and
01:29:18.800 then I realized you've done all these things like you wrote for five hours you got a workout in you took your dog for a
01:29:26.080 walk you know you helped out around the house you did all these things dude
01:29:31.199 watch a freaking dog video for 20 minutes it's fine and then I could actually appreciate that more and like I
01:29:36.719 didn't have the guilt around that you know and it was like sort of the all right you've invested a bunch you got
01:29:42.159 all this money yeah and buy that buy that thing you don't necessarily need but it's going to it's nice little boost you know i'd like to take a quick break

01:29:49.600 and acknowledge one of our sponsors Function last year I became a Function member after searching for the most
01:29:55.280 comprehensive approach to lab testing function provides over 100 advanced lab tests that give you a key snapshot of
01:30:02.320 your entire bodily health this snapshot offers you with insights on your heart health hormone health immune functioning
01:30:08.800 nutrient levels and much more they've also recently added tests for toxins such as BPA exposure from harmful
01:30:14.800 plastics and tests for PASES or forever chemicals function not only provides testing of over a 100 biomarkers key to
01:30:21.679 your physical and mental health but it also analyzes these results and provides insights from top doctors who are expert
01:30:27.920 in the relevant areas for example in one of my first tests with Function I learned that I had elevated levels of
01:30:33.679 mercury in my blood function not only helped me detect that but offered insights into how best to reduce my
01:30:39.280 mercury levels which included limiting my tuna consumption i've been eating a lot of tuna while also making an effort
01:30:44.960 to eat more leafy greens and supplementing with knack and acetylcysteine both of which can support glutathione production and
01:30:50.719 detoxification and I should say by taking a second function test that approach worked comprehensive blood
01:30:56.400 testing is vitally important there's so many things related to your mental and physical health that can only be
01:31:01.920 detected in a blood test the problem is blood testing has always been very expensive and complicated in contrast
01:31:07.679 I've been super impressed by Function's simplicity and at the level of cost it is very affordable as a consequence I
01:31:14.159 decided to join their scientific advisory board and I'm thrilled that they're sponsoring the podcast if you'd
01:31:19.360 like to try Function you can go to functionhealth.com/huberman function currently has a wait list of
01:31:24.800 over 250,000 people but they're offering early access to Huberman podcast listeners again that's
01:31:31.280 functionhealth.com/huberman to get early access to function the idea
01:31:35.000 No text
01:31:36.400 that we all have to become these sickos that love um that love self-punishment
01:31:41.679 in service to just building up more dopamine reserves that's that's definitely not the goal i mean I think one of the reasons that David Gogggins
01:31:48.080 is so popular uh is well there are many reasons um a he he is how he appears
01:31:54.560 online i mean I've known David since before he had a book since his before his first book he was exactly that way
01:32:00.159 he was exactly that way he's not playing a role right there's no acting this is how he functions that's great it's a
01:32:07.040 life that most people are not going to embrace um and if they do embrace it partially I think it will benefit them
01:32:12.880 tremendously but he he sort of embodies that he excuse me he doesn't sort of embody that he embodies that i think
01:32:19.760 that being able to relax and enjoy things and really savor them uh is another source of of of
01:32:27.280 I won't say everything's investing but there are certain things that might look like spending your dopamine that are actually investing them and you
01:32:32.719 described a beautiful one as walking with your wife these long these long hikes and walks like real relating
01:32:39.600 in-person relating I think uh makes us feel so many things i mean there's so
01:32:45.120 much science and psychology about this that I mean we definitely evolve to to connect
01:32:50.639 to other humans absolutely you know so I I don't think of it as um meaningless
01:32:55.840 relaxation to to just connect with people and have a barbecue and just relax or just what what do they call it
01:33:01.600 like Netflix and chill can be a great thing if it's not the only thing the internet has allowed us a lot of
01:33:07.040 interesting new ways to connect with other people um so we were talking before we uh hit the red button on
01:33:13.280 record how I'm into the Grateful Dead right and I think that you can find a lot of different sort of strange tribes
01:33:19.600 to belong to and they can be enhanced by the internet you know it's like when I
01:33:24.960 got into the dead it was like okay now I'm listening to the the live shows i'm going down this rabbit hole well I'd
01:33:30.560 find these Reddit threads where people are discussing the live shows and like hey if you listen to how Jerry plays this song in 78 versus 79 and I'm like
01:33:38.159 oh okay listen oh wow yeah that's really interesting so then you start weighing in and then you're friends with you know
01:33:43.280 Deadhead 778 who you don't even know who the hell he is or where the hell he lives but like this is a great guy
01:33:48.560 online that I can talk to and then you eventually sort of find yourself at the shows and you're connecting with these
01:33:54.239 people that you would probably otherwise never connect with in normal life and there's like you know the hippie who's
01:34:00.239 got like two bucks in a dream to get to the next show in tie-dye and then there's the hippie who's got the Rolex
01:34:05.600 and he's taking his private jet to the next show on your right but you're all in it together you know and you're sort
01:34:10.800 of like connecting for this sort of big sort of group thing and I think you could apply that to music you could
01:34:17.199 apply it to sports teams this sort of shared cause and the internet I do think can allow you to find those sort of many
01:34:23.840 tribes you know yeah I love it i just now um allowing myself to get familiar
01:34:29.679 with the Grateful Dead i did go to a bunch of shows because they were from my hometown right awesome they California
01:34:35.040 Avenue was where Drapers Music and some of those Grateful Dead band members worked and uh there was a great
01:34:41.120 bookstore there Printers Inc and uh so they were kind of an institution in the South Bay where I grew up but uh I fell
01:34:47.199 into a different genre of music but um there's some great music um that out there but I think the culture around the
01:34:54.159 dead the fact that people would devote their entire lives to quote unquote following the dead um and still now like
01:35:00.639 people go Oh totally like with Fish and Dead In Company this is like an outgrowth of the of uh of something that
01:35:07.440 I don't know of any other band that that had people change their entire lives in terms of the whole structure of their
01:35:14.000 lives yeah i mean I went a bunch of times when they're in Vegas at the Sphere i have another fun thing and
01:35:19.920 there's like that shared sense of connection whether it's a sports team whether it's a hobby whether it's a type
01:35:26.480 of music um when we were when I was on this long hike um you get within shooting distances of towns and that's
01:35:32.480 where you have to go resupply but you might be 40 miles from a town so you're like "All right we got to hitchhike
01:35:37.520 right?" So we got to ride into this town called Escalan Utah it's this tiny town
01:35:42.560 so we go restock food you know we each eat like a 16inch pizza ourselves and
01:35:48.159 like wings because you got to refuel and then we're at this gear store and we need a ride back to the trail head it's
01:35:54.159 like 40 miles away so it's like how the hell are we going to find a ride like this is going to take forever to hitchhike i'm in this gear store and um
01:36:00.880 they happen to have this uh I can't remember what it was it might have been like a beanie or something that had a dead head on it i picked it up i'm like
01:36:06.080 "Oh this is awesome." And this lady comes up to me and she goes "Oh you like the dead?" Like "Yeah I like the dead." And she works in the shop and she's like
01:36:11.679 "Yeah me too." We start talking well turns out this lady's seen him like 500 to a thousand times was her estimate
01:36:18.159 like well it's a big estimate but that's a lot of shows right um and we just immediately connect and she's like "Oh
01:36:23.920 you need a ride back to the trail head." I'm like "That would be great." Yeah and it's just like just that thing that
01:36:30.080 little emblem of the dead immediately allowed us to have this conversation and
01:36:36.159 have this fi this shared sense of connection so kind of finding something to identify with with people I think can
01:36:42.080 be just like a a great adventure and like you meet new people like go out and find interesting communities to belong
01:36:47.760 to try stuff i mean this is the power so you had um Ryan in for the recovery and
01:36:53.679 addiction podcast like that's Yeah that's the power of recovery groups it's the power is in the group because you've
01:37:00.560 got this shared identity with people you have people keeping tabs on you you're keeping tabs on other people they help
01:37:05.760 you you help them you share your stories they know things about you that probably no one else does and there's an identity
01:37:12.000 in that and it's powerful it's why that works if you you know if uh I'm gonna
01:37:18.560 forget the names of the founders Bill Wilson if he found if he founded that online and was like "Hey we're all just going to chat on AOL Messenger
01:37:25.920 probably would have helped a lot of people but it would not have the power that it would have of getting people together to converse." I think it's
01:37:33.440 harder for people to go out and do that today because there is a it's it's much easier to only do things sort of online
01:37:40.880 and sort of you know be a little bit of a a hermit if you will and I think
01:37:46.239 forcing yourself to go into new places meet new people try new things get into
01:37:51.679 new stuff and go out and meet people in in person can be really powerful today I
01:37:57.440 wrote a post on 2% about the value of gathering and sort of identifying
01:38:03.600 identifying with something like whether it be a band or a team or whatever um and I talked to this researcher um she's
01:38:09.840 up in Oregon i forget what university uh and I'm sorry for that but she talked about how um the internet when used
01:38:16.639 appropriately can be a really great community builder and she also said the best thing that can happen is when those
01:38:23.760 type of communities then figure out ways to meet up in person like that's that's
01:38:29.600 the perfect next step and it all starts with like okay we have this community online oh I'm going to be in San
01:38:36.800 Francisco who in the group is San Francisco based let's meet up and get coffee and I do think you're starting to see more of that happen like it's
01:38:43.280 happening on Substack with a lot of writers um for example I do events that I call the Don't Die event and um it's
01:38:50.480 me it's this is different than the Brian Johnson Don't Die event yeah this is different yeah this is different this is the original Don't Die this is a
01:38:56.000 different type of Don't Die yeah the original Don't Die um what we do is it's uh me and my friend Mike Moreno amazing
01:38:58.000 No text
01:39:03.280 guy mike was a was a CIA case officer in uh Iraq and Afghanistan I believe and um
01:39:10.960 we basically teach people like travel wilderness survival skills over two days and so it's most of the people that come
01:39:16.960 are from people who read my Substack and so it's people who are often active in the comments they they all know each other like people show up and they know
01:39:23.280 each other from the internet and then we all hang out and we do awesome stuff together and it's just like it's the
01:39:28.719 best but it's like that step to get people in person I think needs to happen
01:39:34.000 and so one thing I've even thought about too is you hear a lot about how um
01:39:40.480 people spend less time together and there's a variety of reasons for that you know people will point to the sort
01:39:45.840 of less activity in organized religion which used to be the sort of hub of sociality in in towns but I also think
01:39:54.400 um things like and I talked to a uh woman I love she's she was with the Wall
01:40:00.480 Street Journal she's back at the Wall Street Journal a reporter um her name is Gwendalyn Bounds Wendy Bounds and she
01:40:06.719 wrote a book called Little Chapel on the River and it's about she was at the Wall Street Journal uh when 911 happened and
01:40:14.639 she was living in the city like she was taking a shower and the plants hit the towers and so to get out of the city she ended up moving to this town called
01:40:20.560 Garrison New York and the heart of this town is this old Irish pub that is right
01:40:27.360 by the train station and she's like "And people from this town would come to this Irish pub and they might have one drink
01:40:36.080 two drinks but it was like the hangout and you'd get you know people who were super right leaning people who were
01:40:42.320 super leftle leaning in the bar and they would you know they'd give each other [ __ ] but it was all in fun." And it was like the heart of community and
01:40:49.119 gathering and human connection and I think you're starting to see a little
01:40:54.400 bit of a death of places like that you know like the the community pillar
01:41:00.560 institution is sort of been replaced by you know chains or something and like
01:41:06.080 yeah people can gather at chains but there's not like that unique identity it's all like predetermined by someone
01:41:11.679 in a corporate office 3,000 miles away and I think there's a case for like
01:41:17.440 trying to find those places that still exist and hang out whether it be you know the pub you don't even have to
01:41:23.440 drink at pubs i can tell you that i don't drink still go hang out at the bar um and I love bars i sometimes work in
01:41:29.280 bars and I don't drink yeah it's great restaurants whatever it might be i think there's a case to get out in the world and again you know I'll go back to the
01:41:35.520 the comfort crisis that I think sometimes that is hard to just go
01:41:41.040 somewhere you're like the new guy hey guys you know um and to strike up a
01:41:47.119 conversation with someone random but I do think it is um really good for us in the long term i think too the internet
01:41:52.719 dehumanizes people right it's um it's easy to yell and scream at an icon
01:42:00.000 that's you know the size of a thumbtack on the screen who said one thing but if
01:42:05.199 that same person was in person across from you across from the bar from you
01:42:10.639 you may not even talk about politics with that person right and here you've you know people make these crazy death threats or something whereas like if
01:42:16.800 that person was just across the bar from you you may not even talk about that and you might actually think they're a great person i'll give you another example
01:42:22.800 more hitchhiking um so we had to get uh we got into this town when we're on this
01:42:28.560 hike resupply we need to get up to the trail head this trail head's um 20
01:42:34.560 minute drive away or something um these people pull over and they say because we got our thumbs
01:42:40.960 out you know we're like old school hobos and um say "Oh do you need a ride?" And
01:42:46.639 it was this couple from China they had come over uh a week ago just for some
01:42:52.000 vacation they're both from China this was at the heart of the trade war the trade war was at its apex when this
01:42:59.679 happens right china had just like decided they're not even going to ship us the some rare minerals we needed i
01:43:05.199 wasn't paying too much attention to the news out there but I was aware of that we get in the car with this couple from
01:43:10.400 China and like that's all happening in the world and guess what no one gave a [ __ ] about
01:43:17.119 in that moment all this media on CNN and Fox and social
01:43:23.600 feeds and everything about the damn trade war these two Americans one of who worked in government for 20 years these
01:43:31.280 two people from China and we're just connecting talking about the United States versus what it's like to live in
01:43:37.119 China oh you guys are academics oh it's fantastic we're just really really connecting and they're doing us this
01:43:43.920 huge favor of giving us a ride up to the trail head and these are two people that like these this is awesome these people
01:43:50.960 are great and like no one gave a [ __ ] about all this noise happening that should seemingly put us in this like
01:43:57.199 maybe tense moment right so I think that when you actually get in front of people and face to face people have about 75
01:44:04.560 million more things in common than they do things that are not in common that
01:44:09.840 they could argue about and it takes that interaction and going out into the world
01:44:15.520 i found that when I travel people everywhere are far more kind happy
01:44:23.840 willing to help than I would have ever expected and I had high expectations going in but it
01:44:30.800 takes those experiences to realize that and I do think that if you're kind of just existing behind a screen where it's
01:44:36.800 easy for people to shout you get this distorted view of the world it's like go out talk to people have different
01:44:42.480 experiences you're going to walk away realizing that hey most people are actually totally fantastic if you just
01:44:48.320 give them the time today talk to them ask them questions and be nice like being nice is the number one tool in my
01:44:56.000 tool book to survive and get along at my job and do all these different like just
01:45:02.800 be nice to people and you'll find that most people are nice back it's this uh
01:45:06.000 No text
01:45:08.239 starting in the real world and perhaps bringing something online you know posting about it or writing about the
01:45:14.239 great experience later as opposed to the online experience brought it into the world the I have a friend that's uh uh
01:45:20.320 he's a very accomplished musician and um he doesn't do his own social media and
01:45:25.760 um we get together for dinner once every couple of weeks and once I got out there and I said "Oh yeah I saw this thing
01:45:31.199 online." He said "I don't want to hear about social media." And I I realized in that moment I was like "Okay got it."
01:45:37.440 Like we we're not going to talk about something that was on social media why would we do that in his mind like why
01:45:42.560 would we do that we're here like why let's have an experience now and I think this can be easy too and I'm I'm going
01:45:47.600 to because I didn't say this and it came to my mind when we were talking about Mogi when I talk about this and I say
01:45:54.239 you know something I did that might seem hard for people um I'll put a cav caveat on that is that there's way more people
01:46:01.600 out there doing even more extreme things at the same time there's people whose entry point like you got to meet you got
01:46:08.080 to do the thing where you're at so I gave this talk right and I talked about masogi in the talk and afterwards this
01:46:15.679 lady comes up to me and she goes "Hey I had read your book and I learned about
01:46:21.119 this masogi idea and she goes "My masogi was trying sushi." I go "Trying sushi?"
01:46:28.480 And she goes "It's trying sushi." I go "Okay tell me about that." She goes,"I just always had this fear around sushi
01:46:35.600 but people told me it was good but I just couldn't i couldn't do it i forced myself to do it." She's like "I didn't
01:46:41.520 love it but I didn't hate it." But more importantly it taught me what other
01:46:48.560 fears do I have about things that are probably totally fine and that opened
01:46:53.760 this big door for me to go try all sorts of new things like oh well I'm kind of afraid of flying alone what if I went
01:47:00.239 and took a trip and visited a friend now I got to go hang out with my friend like it just opens doors right and so really
01:47:06.320 it can be anything can be something totally ex objectively extreme and crazy
01:47:12.400 it can be trying sushi just try something so it's really about pushing up against those edges in real life
01:47:19.600 wherever the edge is do you think it's possible to structure one's day around
01:47:24.960 making the morning and day really tough and when I say tough I mean um in the
01:47:31.119 sense that you go against your um impulse to do things the easy way and
01:47:36.400 then making your evenings and nights really relaxing yeah I try and do that um I'll get into the heinous details
01:47:43.600 about my evenings in a moment but I'll tell you about my mornings and I'd actually like to hear about how you approach this too um so in the morning I
01:47:50.880 wake up uh usually very early now I'll I'll put a asterisk there that I also go
01:47:55.920 to bed early so I wake up at like in between 3:30 and 4:30 what time do you go to sleep probably 8:30 okay so wake
01:48:03.199 up at 3:30 get a cup of coffee immediately I go to my desk and I just I write and I sit
01:48:12.080 there and to your point it takes a little bit of that warm up right um but
01:48:18.000 I know as a writer the more time I'm in my chair behind that keyboard the more
01:48:23.760 likely I am to produce words that um work for the goal I'm trying to accomplish so I need that say four or
01:48:31.760 five hours every single day and it is hard it's usually like the first two hours of just like "Oh you suck at this
01:48:39.440 this is terrible why did you choose this career?" How does your body feel physically is writing hard for you like
01:48:46.480 is the chair comfortable are you feeling strained are you relaxed is it all just mentally hard or is it physically
01:48:52.320 demanding as well i would say it's more mentally you kind of just get in it for me it's like you get in this zone and
01:48:58.880 you're like I got this idea like how am I going to put this down and you write something out you're like that's not it
01:49:04.159 but there's like this one nugget okay take that one nugget now what can we do with that and it's kind of like putting
01:49:09.760 together this really like kind of difficult puzzle um but I've also found that eventually you kind of start to hit
01:49:15.440 a stride and things start to work and I I know that some days I'm going to sit there for five hours and I'm going to
01:49:21.040 get out like 300 words and they're going to be okay but some days like just boom
01:49:26.239 magic happens and I might bang out like 3,000 words and I'm like those are those
01:49:31.440 are decent those are decent words but if I'm not there doing that every single morning despite knowing that most days
01:49:37.520 it's probably going to be hard like book's not going to write itself right so I do think like with a lot of things
01:49:43.920 that um a person might want to improve in you really do have to be willing to put
01:49:50.239 in the time and realize that this is going to be there's going to be really challenging moments um but those
01:49:56.320 challenging moments they also make the days when you get the metaphorical 3,000 decent words they make it just awesome
01:50:02.800 so to lean into that so that's kind of like how I approach my mornings and evenings um like I kind of alluded to
01:50:08.560 with social media how now I've just kind of let off and just let myself be okay with just letting my brain turn off
01:50:15.520 my wife and I watch some pretty heinous reality television that is our thing
01:50:21.520 turn on big fan of Real Housewives of Salt Lake City okay I will admit it okay
01:50:27.360 i I confess I've never seen that one is it don't start just watch stuff like that and it's just
01:50:34.000 like you know can connect over this totally just mindless show and it's almost like it's kind of a reset it's
01:50:39.520 like you know those ladies throwing drinks in each other's faces screaming at each other it's just a nice little
01:50:45.760 beep your brain's reset for the day so you're writing from about 3:30 in the morning 4 in the morning until you said
01:50:52.080 about four hours yeah four or five hours yeah all you're getting up to use the the bathroom yeah yeah you're drinking
01:50:58.080 some more coffee some more water yeah I might get another coffee you have breakfast before usually after after and
01:51:03.760 then what happens um between 8 am and uh and really house and Salt Lake City
01:51:09.679 housewife she called after I've got like the key core writing in i would say that then I
01:51:16.239 um focus on what I not eloquently at all say would be the sort of [ __ ] you
01:51:22.080 know like we got all these emails to respond to got to do sort of this task and that task um whatever project isn't
01:51:28.159 sort of like my main writing probably [ __ ] is not the right word for it because it's important stuff but I just sort of value that writing time and then
01:51:35.280 I will usually uh I'll usually exercise before I eat dinner usually around 4 um
01:51:42.960 I tried exercising in the morning for a while but I realized that that is like my peak hours for writing and that was
01:51:49.440 kind of getting interrupted and so I'm like okay I'm good with it being before dinner do you do caffeine before your
01:51:54.960 afternoon workout i'm just curious no not usually i usually shut off uh
01:52:00.639 caffeine probably around noon probably heard that on this podcast actually but I found I
01:52:06.560 actually years ago um I did a sort of caffeine audit and my
01:52:14.320 caffeine was out of control and so I just did cold turkey quit i
01:52:20.880 felt like I was literally had the like felt like I had the flu for about 28 hours and then I slept for 18 hours
01:52:27.360 straight and then I had a headache for a week um but I felt a little better and so I've tried to be a little more
01:52:32.719 cognizant of how's the intake going some days I'm better than others you know sometimes sometimes I go "So you had two
01:52:42.080 32 ounce cold brews today um seems like a lot of caffeine for one man you know
01:52:48.000 but you can do I mean you're talking to a lifelong caffeine addict here so I I
01:52:53.360 unless I've had a cold or a flu I I don't take breaks and I consume an outrageous amount of caffeine how much do you think you consume um I'm going to
01:53:00.159 shock some people but I'm very caffeine tolerant i should say that first and um uh and I'm actually a pretty mellow
01:53:07.599 person yeah um and I probably consume distributed from the
01:53:14.880 morning until about 2 or 3 p.m usually 2 p.m is my cut off um somewhere between 600 and 800 milligrams of caffeine a day
01:53:22.480 but before people bulk at that keep in mind that when you look up online you know you go "Oh Chad GPT how much
01:53:28.560 caffeine is in a typical cup of coffee?" It's going to say like 150 milligrams of caffeine if you go to like a Starbucks
01:53:36.159 or a Pete's coffee or they're brewing it much stronger than that so a small probably has somewhere between 200 and
01:53:43.280 250 medium is going to be 350 to 500 i once said that you know a venty coffee
01:53:50.800 what I call a large um but just to orient people um can have 800 to 1,000
01:53:56.639 milligrams of caffeine people like no way and then I got some brush back on that look people have tested this out
01:54:02.719 different places are brewing them differently so what most people are consuming a lot more caffeine than than
01:54:08.719 they realize which is why they have a headache when they don't drink it um I like caffeine but mostly in the form of
01:54:14.239 of yerba mate either this or or um uh just brewed leaves and it's a very
01:54:20.400 different um caffeine high it it rises more slowly it kind of
01:54:25.760 arcs down you if I drink a coffee um as opposed to espresso or yerba mate it's a
01:54:31.280 real punch so I'm not drinking 800 milligrams of co caffeine from coffee so very different i mean my day looks quite
01:54:37.000 No text
01:54:38.159 different than yours but um I definitely agree that once we figure out our
01:54:44.639 optimal circadian schedule which for you sounds like you're a true probably genetically from what we understand
01:54:50.880 early bird you like to go to bed somewhere between 8 and 9:00 p.m wake up somewhere between 3 and 4:00 a.m most
01:54:56.960 people who try and get on that schedule really struggle um and they start to revert to toward the more typical
01:55:02.320 schedule or the night owl schedule but most people like me go to bed somewhere between 10 and 11:30 at night i can get
01:55:09.360 to bed by 9:30 but it's tough um typically go 10:30 in bed 11 I'm out and
01:55:14.719 then if I do that I need maybe six and a half hours of sleep and I'm fine yeah and then the night owls definitely exist
01:55:20.880 there are people for whom their genetic polymorphisms in in their genome make them want to go to bed at 1 two 3 a.m
01:55:27.520 and sleep until you know 8 nine 10 even 11 am and they do best uh but I agree
01:55:33.280 that once you figure out your optimal circadian schedule um early bird typical
01:55:39.679 or night owl that there are couple of three to fourhour pockets during the day
01:55:45.920 when our attention and wakefulness is just at its greatest and you have to decide what you're going to devote that
01:55:51.679 to and from what we understand that morning bout which for you falls very
01:55:57.040 early is when the catakolamines dopamine norepinephrine and epinephrine are really being released at their greatest
01:56:03.119 amount it's almost like the bank account to invest you okay you can you can invest now you're going to spend you're
01:56:08.639 going to invest and I think many people spend it out um and exercise is great i
01:56:15.119 notic that card cardio so to speak um gives me a lot of energy and focus in
01:56:21.520 the hours that follow whereas resistance training which arguably I like to train hard and I like training heavy
01:56:28.960 afterwards if I shower up and eat something I'm my brain is fatigued in a way that I'm like damn I I invested it
01:56:36.239 in exercise i I can't invest in everything so I think finding those times when we are optimal is great and
01:56:43.599 not just spending it out on meaningless stuff and that's what's happened to so many of these I hear from a lot of young
01:56:49.520 guys on this in particular um guys who are like hitting their early mid late
01:56:55.040 20s and they're like my life is like not heading in a particular direction the so-called failure to launch kids and
01:57:01.599 it's scary and then you say well what are you spending your time on like well I get some exercise but then a lot of
01:57:07.040 YouTube a lot of video games a lot of spending out and I realize that there are some people who can make a career
01:57:12.480 out of video games but most can't right so I I think um there are a lot of
01:57:18.800 casualties of of that kind of spending out of that those key hours yeah I think so too and I do agree with you that it's
01:57:25.280 all about finding whatever's going to work for you got to find that sort magic those magic hours you know as I would
01:57:30.960 call them in a non-scientific way um the example I always like to give is Hunter S thompson where he would sleep until
01:57:39.199 noon and then he would start writing at like 11 p.m maybe and he would go till 4
01:57:45.199 in the morning and of course he's fueled by all this nonsense on you know going into that but that was like his that was
01:57:51.440 sort of his magic hours where he got the best work done and it's like you got to find you got to find what yours are yeah
01:57:56.800 it's interesting uh the reliance these days on energy drinks and caffeine and supplements some of which we've talked
01:58:02.239 about on this podcast like alpha GPC like they'll have a meaningful um effect on your levels of alertness and focus i
01:58:09.280 think it's a mistake to use those to just kind of exist like sipping an energy drink just to get through your
01:58:15.280 day i do think there's a place for the occasional use of things like alpha GPC or caffeine certainly some people
01:58:21.119 nowadays are using non-smoke non-vaped nicotine uh the great Joe Strummer said
01:58:26.400 that one of the worst things that ever happened to creativity is people stop smoking i'm not encouraging people to start smoking he died young sadly uh 50
01:58:35.119 um but uh you know I think the idea there was that nicotine is cognitively
01:58:41.119 enhancing you don't want to take it in in a way that kills you but I think if you're going to explore chemistry for um
01:58:49.119 changing your your brain state which is what it's all about um
01:58:54.719 that you want to be really careful about what you do with that enhanced brain state like just drinking a bunch of
01:59:00.239 energy drinks to scroll the internet is truly a waste of a life yeah getting all ramped up to do nothing basically right
01:59:07.440 yeah get all ramped up to do something that's a good rule to follow when you're out on these adventures um do you have
01:59:12.000 No text
01:59:15.599 all your comforts from home of like to bed at a certain at your early hour up
01:59:21.920 at an early hour um are you still writing before you head out i guess some days you can't do you do you bring
01:59:28.080 coffee i mean are there certain things that you bring with you so that you're not just in a complete stoic mode of you're not like naked in the woods i
01:59:34.480 think that's a different reality TV show right yeah yeah we don't watch that one um
01:59:40.400 I will bring So I'll give you It kind of depends on the trip um a lot of them if
01:59:45.520 it's uh international things get a little skewed with time changes and
01:59:51.440 things like that um but if it's sort of a outdoor adventure I'm usually up
01:59:57.920 pretty early with the sun i also notice that I sleep a lot better and longer when I'm out in the wilderness just way
02:00:05.360 better um so I usually get up and um I usually bring coffee if it's an outdoor
02:00:10.480 thing just like instant crap coffee but it tastes great out there because that's what you got um I often don't bring a
02:00:18.159 stove when I do outdoor uh adventure stuff simply because one it's more
02:00:23.920 weight to carry uh two I've heard horror stories of people who are boiling water
02:00:30.159 on these awkward stoves and then oh they knocked it into their lap and now we have like a serious emergency in the
02:00:35.599 middle of freaking nowhere um so I don't bring a stove and so I'll just mix the instant coffee with whatever temperature
02:00:42.960 the water temperature is like the outdoor temperature right so if it's 33 degrees outside the water's 33 degrees
02:00:49.360 I'll drink that and then usually just You don't bring a stove on these long adventures no um wow yeah then I'll get
02:00:57.119 moving on this last hike a lot of lot of bars for calories you're basically just
02:01:03.360 looking for foods that um so sort of the rules to kind of give people some uh advice here and I can put that in the
02:01:09.040 link we talked about um one it's got to be good on my stomach that's rule number one because if you eat something that's
02:01:15.760 going to upset your stomach and you got to hike 25 miles you're going to have a really really bad day right so figuring
02:01:21.679 that out um that tends to be foods that aren't super super fibery and um are are
02:01:29.440 a little more processed rather than less so your stomach's not doing the processing um two it obviously has to be
02:01:36.080 calorie dense because if you take let's say to give a kind of extreme example 2
02:01:41.440 lbs in peanut butter that has way more calories than two pounds in apples and it also takes up uh less room in your
02:01:48.320 pack right so stuff tends to be calorie dense like nuts bars things like that um
02:01:54.239 at night I'll have like tortillas and salami and some dried fruit things like that um number three is that it has to
02:02:00.000 taste good because if you don't like how it tastes you're probably not going to eat it and if you don't eat it it's not
02:02:05.760 going to help you right you're just carrying it and then four I kind of look at like nutritional
02:02:11.920 composition i'll go okay am I getting enough protein now granted when I'm out in a scenario like that you're eating so
02:02:18.320 much food that you basically get enough protein on accident like it's hard to not get enough protein when you're eating 4,000 calories a day but those
02:02:24.560 are sort of the rules I follow nutritionally when I'm out on these journeys interesting yeah one big win
02:02:31.040 that I found um are these bars from and I have no affiliation with these guys um
02:02:36.719 it's I think it's called it's made by Met RX and it's called the Big 100 Bar
02:02:42.080 so this is like a bar designed for straight up meat heads okay um
02:02:47.119 but it's got like 400 something calories in it's got 30 grams of protein and I stumbled upon these in these little in
02:02:52.639 this little gas station in this the town is one gas station in a hotel and they
02:02:57.760 have all these different flavors they taste like candy bars and I'm like this is a thing that I am probably never
02:03:03.280 going to eat in normal life but this is magic out on the trail cuz it's just a hunk of calories with protein and they
02:03:10.320 like inject it with all sorts of vitamin and minerals just like way over fortified like this is trail food right
02:03:16.080 here as you pointed out very different than what you recommend people eat back home totally people should probably eat
02:03:22.480 exact opposite way back home exact fruits vegetables clean meats eggs fish you know this kind of thing yeah
02:03:29.360 generally like my people will ask me about nutrition advice and mine is
02:03:34.560 basically just like try and eat more foods that uh are ingredients rather than have ingredients if you can just
02:03:39.760 follow that you're probably going to be all right in real life in real life yeah yeah yeah i definitely follow it not on
02:03:44.880 the trail on the trail just just realize you're going to be uh eating a lot of
02:03:50.320 crap for 30 days and then when you get home or 40 days whatever it might be when you get home maybe lean into salads
02:03:57.840 well it's survival out there you said you're losing weight even though you're consuming a ton of calories when you're out on these adventures yeah so for the
02:04:04.400 last one for example that was 40 days um we probably averaged 20 to 25 miles a
02:04:13.760 day um some days are a little more slowgoing because you might have to navigate a canyon there's a lot of ups a lot of downs um but we also had sections
02:04:20.960 on the Arizona Trail which is like this really well-maintained trail um so we had like a 40 mile day that day um and
02:04:28.159 you have everything in your pack so you're carrying the pack and I was trying to eat between 4,000 and 5,000
02:04:34.080 calories a day and I still lost about 13 pounds wow yeah i talked to Herman Poner
02:04:40.080 at Duke and he did some back of the hand math he was like "Okay I'm going to figure this out." He's like "Caveat i'm
02:04:46.560 just doing this in my head right now." He's like "Okay you How much did you weigh how much did you Okay he thought I
02:04:51.840 was probably burning about 6,300 calories a day wow it's a lot of work
02:04:57.000 No text
02:04:57.280 the I think some people will hear 40 days and go like "Okay I don't have time for this i can't get away from this."
02:05:02.560 But you mentioned something that I think is worth pointing out and it it offers an opportunity for um people to access
02:05:08.080 some of the incredible things that um these outdoor adventures provide and that's the reset to sleep and sleeping
02:05:14.560 outside there's a uh a guy uh researcher at uh University of Colorado Boulder by
02:05:20.639 the name of Kenneth Wright who's done these really beautiful experiments where he takes students camping mhm where they
02:05:26.960 go to sleep shortly after sunset i think they have a nice campfire and enjoy you know samores and socializing and then
02:05:32.639 they get into their tents and maybe read a bit and they go to sleep and then they wake up somewhere circa sunrise not
02:05:39.040 exactly there but but no one's using an alarm no one's being told when to wake up and they get up and they do their breakfast so they're just camping in the
02:05:44.800 Colorado mountains for a couple of days what he found was that just two nights and and the days around those nights of
02:05:52.239 camping in the Colorado mountains um allowed them to reset their circadian
02:05:57.599 rhythms for melatonin which elevates at night kickstart the sleep process as many people know and for cortisol which
02:06:03.760 is why we wake up in the morning the so-called cortisol awakening response you know precedes uh the time we wake up
02:06:09.040 which for you comes at a god awful hour from but um and was able to reset that those cortisol melatonin rhythms which
02:06:15.520 really bookend end uh our days and are and and really establish regularity of
02:06:20.719 circadian rhythm so while there are a lot of things one can do like cold showers and exercise and forced early
02:06:26.159 hours and dimming the lights etc when getting out into nature and camping for a couple of nights really getting away
02:06:32.400 from cell phone contact and getting more oriented to the sunrise and sunset as
02:06:38.159 the cues for circadian rhythm um has a longlasting effect on uh circadian
02:06:43.599 rhythms of these hormones and wakefulness so it's you know it's getting back to the fundamentals i just offer that because some people might
02:06:48.960 hear like 40 days and like [ __ ] I don't want to like just eat peanut butter and when I hear that you don't bring a stove
02:06:55.520 like now I'm looking at you different like this guy's psychotic and in the in the in the good sense of the word right
02:07:00.560 um it's awesome no no it's it's when I say psychotic in the form of a good kind
02:07:05.760 yeah it's the good kind um but I think most people think okay I could probably get away for two three nights yeah and
02:07:12.639 and camp or talk to someone who knows how to backpack and get a proper kit together and go backpacking yeah and and
02:07:19.679 the level of adventure and and life reset and meaningful experiences that one brings back from that and reset of
02:07:26.079 circadian rhythm is is super significant totally there's and it's amazing i mean
02:07:32.320 when you look at how much of the US is actually like developed
02:07:37.679 it's some crazy number like only three 4% is occupied by people and the rest is
02:07:43.119 just like farmland and open land like we have so much amazing unbelievable public
02:07:49.360 lands in the United States and by the way as I experienced the best stuff
02:07:54.639 isn't necessarily in national parks the best stuff is often in these sort of middle of nowhere places where it would
02:08:00.239 just be a giant logistical nightmare to try and put a national park there and get all these people into it like you
02:08:05.280 can find some just incredible places in the US and even I think three nights
02:08:10.960 outdoors two one night two nights whatever any amount of time outdoors especially if it's a little more rugged
02:08:18.000 a little more off the grid and hell you can even car camp like you don't have to like walk 20 miles out into the middle
02:08:23.679 of nowhere you can car camp i think that has just so many benefits there's um
02:08:29.280 this guy at University of Utah named uh David Straer and he did uh he's done
02:08:34.719 this work on what he calls a three-day effect and he's basically found that after uh three days in nature like some
02:08:40.000 really beneficial things happen to people and people come back reporting that they just feel so much calmer more
02:08:46.159 collected they're just like more reset more aligned in their life and I think that's absolutely a thing the reason he
02:08:53.679 started studying it is because a guy who owns this sort of famous rare book shop
02:08:59.920 in Salt Lake City the guy's name is Ken Sanders he was calling this thing that would happen to him the three-day effect
02:09:06.560 he goes "Yeah we just call it the three-day effect among my friends." And he was like a friend of Edward Abby the environmental writer he's like "Yeah we
02:09:12.480 call it the three-day effect like after three days in the wild you like just totally reset you're a better human you think better you're nicer you're more
02:09:18.639 empathetic you're just a great person." And Strayer was kind of like wait I feel like that's happened to me but I've just
02:09:24.320 never heard anyone sort of put a term on it and so he started kind of doing some research into it and it's actually
02:09:29.360 pretty interesting stuff super interesting i think uh my mind as the neurobiologist goes to these attractor
02:09:35.760 states i think that it takes some time for us to drop into these different ways of being and ways of being sounds kind
02:09:41.679 of mystical psychological but it's it's also neural right is that our our nervous system shapes itself around the
02:09:48.800 interactions and vice versa and I think I find uh your work so interesting
02:09:55.119 because you're a sit in a chair for four hours cognitive thinker toil with words
02:10:01.280 and ideas guy but you like these long extended adventures which are really um
02:10:07.199 adventures of the body and mind uh I I've been wrestling with this idea as
02:10:10.000 No text
02:10:12.880 you can tell today i wanted to just present your some ideas to you to get your your thoughts on them um and one of
02:10:19.199 the ideas and I've talked to a couple of MDs that work specifically on dementia uh about this and and the idea hasn't
02:10:26.480 been killed yet which is a sign that they might have legs and the idea is that um comes from this originates with
02:10:33.360 this sea squirt do you know the story about the sea squirt no so the sea squirt are uh I I've been learning about
02:10:38.800 them they're in this um the film of a tunicata they're tunicquates which means nothing you when anytime somebody throws
02:10:45.440 something like that or a Latin name uh they're really just trying to impress you but what's interesting about tunicquets is that they live two lives
02:10:52.400 they have a nervous system they live two lives they they are mobile they swim for part of their life and then they at some
02:10:59.199 point descend onto a a rock typically fix themselves to the rock and live the rest of their life fixed to that rock
02:11:06.079 and when they land there they eventually learn how to harvest nutrients from from
02:11:11.520 the ocean around them but they eat their own nervous system they eat their own brain and they specifically eat they
02:11:17.920 don't really have a brain but they eat the components of their nervous system that aren't required for moving around anymore interesting so one idea sorry to
02:11:25.920 like noodle with this and I was thinking you know we we hear so much now about the relationship between exercise and
02:11:31.040 longevity and you know I try and get my zone 2 cardio i definitely ruck we're going to talk about rucking i do my
02:11:37.280 resistance training i'm very interested in some of these functional patterns folks online they're very um combative people but they they've got some really
02:11:43.679 interesting points about the need to do more um real world throwing sprinting
02:11:48.800 type activities but here's an idea if we step back from the human species and we
02:11:53.840 go okay what what do humans need we need to reproduce take care of our young propagate all the stuff we talked about
02:11:58.960 before but throughout human evolution humans have gotten to a point where in
02:12:04.000 everyone's life where at some point the young are old enough and and educated enough about what's required to be a
02:12:10.079 human that they don't have to throw run or do any of these things and perhaps
02:12:15.599 and someone should look at this I think perhaps the areas of the brain that atrophy first the neural pathways that
02:12:22.239 atrophy first in everybody we're not talking about Alzheimer's necessarily are the areas involved with jumping
02:12:27.840 landing throwing navigating uh uneven surfaces um lack of familiarity you know
02:12:35.599 as and it could be that the deterioration of those pathways sets in
02:12:41.440 motion a cascade of of things that cause the loss of neurons in other areas and then like so many things you know it
02:12:47.520 tends to then we get like everyone gets demented with age no one is sharper at
02:12:52.639 90 than they were at 70 no one unless you know maybe they lost a lot of weight and took a bunch of you know acetyloline
02:12:59.360 promoting drugs or something but that's very rare so the idea here is that um maybe we're a lot like the sea squirt
02:13:06.800 um we're just starting earlier nowadays and that's interesting and that perhaps
02:13:11.920 some of the things that you're doing um in these uh msogi adventures are um
02:13:19.280 forcing you to do things that are maintaining brain circuitry that allow you to sit in that office and and and
02:13:25.760 attack it with more vigor with each year i I I I like this idea um first of all
02:13:32.239 it's not testable that that sucks we it would it's going to be hard to do you could do jumping and plyometrics and landing and look at brain scans you
02:13:37.840 could do that but it's going to be hard to do in the real world but I like this idea because everything that you've told us is that we need to do the thing that
02:13:45.920 we could easily offload onto devices or other people but if we
02:13:52.719 don't do that we actually have more uh pleasure in these moments of
02:13:59.760 watching television with a spouse or perhaps even more intellectual vigor because how old are you i'm 38 38 um so
02:14:09.199 if you were to now I' I'm kind of leading the I'm seeding the question um
02:14:14.320 but if you were to kind of plot in your mind like your your cognitive vigor across these years before during and and
02:14:22.079 now you're continuing to do these massogis would you say your cognitive vigor is is declining or is increasing
02:14:27.520 or is staying flat definitely increasing i'll put the the the confounding the
02:14:33.840 confounder here is uh I stopped drinking when I was 28 so basically up to 28 I
02:14:39.040 was a damn idiot um but I think that where I've sort of taken things I mean
02:14:44.800 I've definitely become a sharper writer a sharper thinker over time um and I
02:14:51.040 think there's something to that i'll say just from the perspective of a writer
02:14:57.199 you will write better and have more material to work with and more interesting writing if you go out and do
02:15:04.239 things shocker right there's so many people who
02:15:10.639 it's just like entirely behind the keyboard looking at a screen not even talking to
02:15:17.599 another human being like even just the reporting part they're not even talking to another human being much less like
02:15:22.960 going out and going there and seeing what they find so just from a writing perspective like
02:15:28.960 of course I still sit behind the screen and read the studies but like I'm also going to go out and talk to this person and I'm going to go do these things that
02:15:36.000 give me so much more to work with and for the average person like okay you're not a writer i get it but that's a story
02:15:44.480 like you want to die with a lot of badass stories like that's a life well-lived right you got to like shape your own narrative and go out and be
02:15:51.040 able to find these moments and things that you've done that you can look back on and be like that was awesome and if
02:15:57.760 you can fill your life up with that because in the moment they're awesome too like happiness is sort of it's not
02:16:03.040 this end point right it's like this rolling average of your behaviors so what do your behaviors look like do you
02:16:08.880 have more awesome behaviors or more crappy behaviors okay let's try and get more awesome behaviors okay well what are awesome behaviors it's like probably
02:16:16.000 involve other people probably involve doing things that push you a little bit and and teach you something about yourself it probably involves getting
02:16:22.560 out of your damn office every now and then and away from the screen and so just trying to get enough of that that's
02:16:28.079 like you know that's it's a thing and I think you're probably right there's a lot happening in the brain too but I'll
02:16:33.360 leave that up to you well yeah i I I I love the notion of creating a life of adventures and happiness as a a rolling
02:16:40.638 average i think that the word happiness is very very uh slippery slope oh
02:16:46.240 totally you're chasing feeling states and Buddhists have talked about this and people talk about this endlessly online
02:16:51.760 no one's talking about being miserable is talking about uh feeling to make it neurobiological
02:16:58.240 that feeling of dopamine being trickled out in response to effort and getting the rewards of the that effort repeat
02:17:04.718 yeah and then the the rewards of course include the non-effort states of being able to lean into uh social things with
02:17:11.840 more ease and more relaxation because you know you put in a really great day or just the richness of what you've
02:17:17.040 built in your life like there's that's happiness that's like deep pleasure right that can only be built through
02:17:23.200 through this kind of uh connection between the these different gears we've been talking about and it just has to be
02:17:29.040 it just has to be pursued and lived out and no one does it perfectly i think that's an important component is like
02:17:34.638 like you can't you can't do the perfect mogi just like because that sort of defeats
02:17:40.320 the purpose right you're supposed to catch splinters and feel miserable and that's part of the the perfect mogi
02:17:47.440 right totally you're not supposed to feel great that's but it's not you feel so miserable that you regret the entire
02:17:52.959 experience yeah you want you want some calluses i'd be interested to hear your thoughts here because this isn't a
02:17:55.000 No text
02:17:59.200 fully formulated thought um but I think a lot of it is channeling that same sort of framework
02:18:06.160 into something that helps you over the long run right so if you think about like the the structure of a lot of the
02:18:13.920 behaviors that hurt people in the long run can also have a similar structure to behaviors that help them that help them
02:18:20.959 in the long run so I'll give you an example something like gambling right it's like this random reward schedule
02:18:26.638 right but when people get hooked on that random reward schedule in the context of gambling it's like the house always wins
02:18:32.240 right and that leads to misery when I think of my own job though it's a very
02:18:38.718 similar random reward structure in terms of searching for information in an open environment with different charact and I
02:18:44.718 don't know what I'm going to get you know it's like okay I'm going to this city it's like when I got to Baghdad I'm like I got to report on the drug trade
02:18:51.840 uh I'm going to have to link up with all these characters i have no idea what's going to happen it's so exciting the reels of the slot machine are spinning
02:18:57.840 the dice are falling same exact thing but it's channeled into a thing that like becomes more rewarding to me over
02:19:04.400 the long run and so I would just like to hear like how do you think about taking that sort of structure and making it
02:19:09.760 helpful for a person yeah well the first thing is that the structure and the circuitry is
02:19:16.400 exactly the same for gambling and going out and finding a great story and building a great story and having those
02:19:22.000 experiences including the pitfalls the losses um that by the way set a lower
02:19:27.679 threshold for what you consider a win and then you ratchet up through there and you know it's like I'll never forget
02:19:32.799 my dad being a scientist who's been on this podcast before i'll never forget the first time I published a paper in science which is like you know it's like
02:19:40.160 Super Bowl ring that he didn't say congratulations you know what he said he said expect yourself to feel kind of low
02:19:46.718 in a few weeks and expect yourself to wonder if it will ever happen again and I said will it ever happen again and he
02:19:52.880 said "Well if I told you that then the experience wouldn't be worth much would it?" I was like "Damn it." The other
02:19:58.640 thing I'll just this is answering your question uh indirectly uh but it's
02:20:03.920 meaningful perhaps is that my graduate adviser when we published that paper I was like "Are we going to throw a party
02:20:09.520 like are we going to celebrate?" She's like "I guess we could get a pizza or something." But um the celebration was
02:20:16.000 the work i was like "What do you mean?" She's like "The work was why was the fun right you had fun doing the
02:20:21.680 experiments." I'm like "Yeah but are we going to celebrate?" We didn't celebrate it and as a consequence you know humbly
02:20:26.800 we went on to publish many many more papers in excellent journals not all in science uh most of them in other
02:20:32.080 journals but that the point being that um she was teaching me to attach the
02:20:37.280 reward to the effort and I was like ah the fun is doing the experiments getting the paper like you have to take the
02:20:43.920 reward and and and relegate it to a place below the effort you can
02:20:50.160 celebrate wins but you you can't let yourself internalize the the wins more than the effort to get there so there's
02:20:57.520 that so um yeah so same circuit it's this dopamine circuitry um and of course
02:21:03.120 when I say dopamine it's that's a proxy for adrenaline and norepinephrine adrenaline is operating in the body to
02:21:08.399 make you feel alert norepinephrine is operating in the brain to make you feel alert so those three work together they're cousins to like get out get up
02:21:14.560 and go pursue things and it doesn't matter if it's a 4:30 wake up or 4:00 a.m wake up sit down and mental movement
02:21:20.800 or it's physical movement i mean evolution designed it this way and it and it's incredibly efficient and it has
02:21:26.800 these pitfalls of gambling um if you have a proclivity for alcohol alcoholism or uh methamphetamine or cocaine or if
02:21:35.600 you like stimulants or um for the process like you know fill in the process addiction shopping sex whatever
02:21:41.280 it happens to be um and that base you're you're draining the bank account on these catacolamines and then the reset
02:21:47.840 is always abstinence it's just abstinence right yeah and then people like people in their second or third
02:21:53.439 year of sobriety are like "Oh my god like the world just feels so incredible." Like there are these these
02:21:58.880 magnificent moments from things that I just completely missed before and it and it's because what brings about pleasure
02:22:04.720 now is a at a you could say it's at a lower threshold but the level of meaning is skyhigh relative to before so So
02:22:11.680 there's that so there's real value to understanding dopamine catakolamine dynamics because you can identify where
02:22:17.680 you are on the map at a given moment that can tell you the direction to go i agree and I wish I could tell you you
02:22:24.000 know you have dopamine catakolamine circuits for writing versus gambling versus uh wandering through Antarctica
02:22:30.319 not wandering but trying to survive Antarctica it's the exact same circuit uh which is you know one of the reasons
02:22:36.000 No text
02:22:36.319 I I want to shift us to rucking okay i really dislike rucking but now you got
02:22:42.479 me rocking so tell tell us why rucking and things like it are so valuable and
02:22:48.800 are distinctly different than like quoteunquote hitting the gym so I'll tell you how I sort of came to
02:22:55.600 this realization started writing about this in the first place is that um when
02:23:00.800 we were in the Arctic were hunting right right so when you look at um why humans
02:23:07.439 are good at running and by the way we're good at two things we're good at running and we're getting at good at caring and
02:23:13.280 I'll tell you why we're good at caring so the reason we're good at running is because we evolved to run long distances
02:23:19.359 to chase down animals in the heat and spear them so humans are really good at cooling ourselves in the heat right and
02:23:26.240 we can run these long distances other animals can't manage their heat so we'd slowly but surely run down animals
02:23:32.319 eventually they would get too hot they'd topple over from heat exhaustion and then bam we'd kill them okay so this is
02:23:39.040 a theory called it's called called persistence hunting so we won the thermmorreulation game we run the won
02:23:44.319 the thermorreulation game yeah so we can we sweat we don't have much fur and then our bodies are also designed for this
02:23:52.240 type of persistence hunting um there's a guy at Harvard Dan Lieberman who had this I think it was in 2004 uh paper
02:23:59.120 about this how the reason we're built the way we are one of the key reasons is uh so we could run long distances for persistence hunting so I'm familiar with
02:24:06.800 that research right i'm like "Oh that's really interesting cool." Like "Yeah this explains why I have like you know
02:24:12.160 these big butt muscles these arched feet these whatever." Um so we go up to the
02:24:17.520 Arctic we're hunting eventually successfully hunted caribou
02:24:23.439 and we you know we're taking every usable part of it we can so we load our packs with all this weight it's like 100
02:24:30.080 something pounds in this damn pack and start walking back to camp and I'm
02:24:35.920 just thinking about this research about okay humans evolved to run long distances so we could hunt great what
02:24:42.479 happens after you actually kill an animal you got to carry that damn thing back to camp right and so it occurs to
02:24:49.520 me well wait a minute we're also pretty unique among animals in that we can carry weight like no other mammal can
02:24:56.640 just pick up weight on its own and carry it a long distance i was like "Huh that's interesting." So I just start
02:25:03.120 looking into this and yeah humans are the only mammal that can pick up a weight and carry it a long distance and
02:25:09.680 it absolutely shaped us into who we are it allowed us to really conquer the globe because we could take tools into
02:25:16.160 the unknown right we can walk we can cover these long distances on our two legs and our feet our hands are freed up
02:25:21.680 to carry our tools to carry whatever it might be and it really turned us into who we are
02:25:27.200 now the thing is is when you look at running plenty of people run right like running and marathons that is a popular
02:25:33.439 activity but how many people are just like carrying weight as a regular form
02:25:38.800 of exercise the answer was really not that many so I'm thinking like okay who
02:25:44.640 actually still maybe does this and it turns out it's the military so rucking is sort of the main activity of physical
02:25:52.560 training in the military just throwing weight in a backpack and going for a long walk and I've actually started to
02:25:59.359 sort of even shift my language from using the term rucking to simply saying walking with weight or weighted walking
02:26:06.720 and the reason for that is is if I tell my mom "Hey you should rock." She goes "Oh okay." And she types in rock and she
02:26:12.720 goes "What the hell is this military stuff Michael i'm 75 years old
02:26:18.319 so I've started to call it more walking with weight so it's a little more approachable for the masses um but I think the benefit of it is that you're
02:26:25.680 getting cardio stimulus because you're covering ground um but you're also getting strength work because you've
02:26:31.120 loaded your skeletal system your muscular system um and that comes with a lot of benefits you kind of got this
02:26:36.880 twoin one so it generally will burn more calories per mile than walking or
02:26:42.479 running and that is simply because you've added extra weight of course if you're running you might cover more distance in the same amount of time but
02:26:49.600 if you just compare it by distance it's burning more calories and um I think
02:26:54.960 it's one of these activities that can really fill in gaps in people's training
02:27:00.240 and to what you sort of alluded to in your question is um there's a variety of reason it fills in gaps but one of them
02:27:05.680 is simply that it gets people outside like there's a lot of gym people who are
02:27:10.720 like "Yeah I lift all the weights but like I'm not doing that running thing." A lot of people can't run and like oh by
02:27:16.160 the way walking feels a little too easy i'm not going to do that so if you can throw some load on someone and have them
02:27:21.359 go for a walk it gets them outside helps them preferentially burn fat it
02:27:26.720 seems compared to um something like running so there's this interesting study and I'll caveat this by saying it was a very small study i think it was
02:27:32.880 only 12 people cuz they could only find 12 crazy enough people to do it it was on uh backcountry hunters in Alaska and
02:27:39.760 so these guys carry these heavy packs out into the mountains for you know a week or whatever and they test them and they ended up losing um a significant
02:27:46.800 amount of weight but it was all from fat they actually gained like a very minute amount of muscle and that really
02:27:53.040 shouldn't happen in the context of going out and losing weight right you're probably going to lose fat along with
02:27:58.560 muscle but with this they ended up losing mostly fat so I just think it's this amazing activity that we really wo
02:28:06.560 out of our lives due to technology humans evolved to carry
02:28:11.920 people were carrying babies all the like every day in the past we'd go hunt and
02:28:16.960 we'd have to carry all the meat back to camp we would carry food that we gathered like gathering we're hunter
02:28:22.240 hunters and gatherers gathering is literally walking around finding some food carrying it finding more carrying
02:28:27.760 it back to camp and then we got you know cars we got grocery carts we got XYZ we
02:28:36.800 got furniture dollies that we don't carry as much and I think we've um lost a really important form of human
02:28:44.720 movement and physical activity that we're literally born to do and so my uh
02:28:50.640 suggestion to all the listeners is get some weight and carry it easy to throw some weight in a backpack and go for a
02:28:56.240 walk and um it'll be good for you how much weight and how far
02:29:01.760 so if someone is just starting I tell them to start light I think so after I
02:29:06.880 published the comfort crisis with the um there's a chap there's an entire chapter on um walking with weight or rocking i
02:29:13.600 got all these people in the military rocking destroyed me okay well how much did the military start you with 100
02:29:20.560 pounds it's like well yeah it's like if you did anything at that intensity
02:29:27.040 immediately just immediately went into like the red you're going to get injured you know it could be squatting it's like
02:29:33.200 yeah I tried to max out on my deadlift every time I deadlifted the first time I deadlifted therefore no one should
02:29:38.319 deadlift right you need to ease into this so I tell people um women can start with anywhere from five to say 20 pounds
02:29:47.920 suggest um men anywhere from 10 to 30 depending on your fitness level i would
02:29:53.680 rather have someone really ease in and sort of get used to it because a lot of people will say "Yeah I went a little
02:29:59.120 too heavy and it really sucked." Like I want you to sort of on ramp slowly and then from there you can build up over
02:30:05.040 time and so I have plenty of you know women who might weigh 130 pounds who now
02:30:10.640 use 30 pounds which is a significant amount of weight yeah um I'll have men
02:30:15.920 who you know maybe they started with 20 and they're like "That's way too light." Like "I I just have too much of a base
02:30:21.120 of fitness." It's like "Okay good well I'm glad we started there though so we know for sure." And then they've ramped up to say 40 sometimes 60 i mean for me
02:30:30.479 I generally my sort of go-to weight is probably 35 to 40 pounds and I find that
02:30:36.080 that's a weight where it's uncomfortable it's challenging but it's also not so soul crushing that I'm like I got to end
02:30:43.280 this walk like this this absolutely sucks i can still enjoy it and of course I'll go heavier sometimes if I'm going
02:30:48.800 really far sometimes I might be like 20 pounds or something you know I think it's really just like start light
02:30:55.120 take a walk see how that feels you know doesn't have to be too complicated yeah i said I I hate rocking but um I love
02:31:02.479 the way I feel afterwards maybe that's the form of exercise I don't like there i just outed myself as not liking a
02:31:07.840 certain I I find that um it forces me to pay attention to some of the smaller
02:31:14.720 stabilizing muscles like you can't be as loose with your gate you have to be pretty thoughtful especially if you're
02:31:19.920 hiking um you can't stride too long here or there you just naturally keeps you
02:31:25.920 moving more like a a packed mule uh which I think can be helpful um and I do
02:31:31.600 notice that when I take off the rucks sack or the vest um on a different day
02:31:36.640 and I and I run I definitely feel faster and lighter just by way of comparison
02:31:41.760 probably a real real change too due to the st small stabilizing muscles this thing about losing more body fat will
02:31:47.200 get will get people motivated people love people love that works i think it's also a good tool for runners because the
02:31:52.240 injury rate is much lower so if you're within a reasonable amount of weight like of course if you go up to these crazy weights so I generally tell people
02:31:58.880 if you just want like a firm number don't go over 50 pounds um if you want a
02:32:04.319 more sort of dialedin number to your body weight don't go over a third of your body weight there's a lot of
02:32:09.520 military research that suggests that but even for me like I don't go up to a third of my body weight all that often
02:32:15.040 unless I have a really good reason i'm training for something like backpacking or hunt or something um so if you're in
02:32:21.840 a within a reasonable amount of weight and not too heavy um the injury rate is exceedingly low it's not that much
02:32:28.160 higher than the injury rate of walking and walking is pretty safe do you ever
02:32:32.000 No text
02:32:33.520 experience the kind of uh crossover of understanding between uh your physical
02:32:40.160 pursuits and your um creative intellectual pursuits like do you find that for instance if you you rock that
02:32:47.040 there's a certain you start to recognize where the resistance is is it putting on the pack is it uh you know a third of
02:32:54.560 the way through you tend to feel pretty good do you notice those contours and do they map to the contour of sitting down
02:33:00.640 and and writing um that it's hard at first then it gets easier and then at some point there's a breakthrough or
02:33:06.160 else it just plain sucks the whole time i think so i'd like to hear your experience with running but my
02:33:12.399 experience with running is that the first say three miles they suck i go
02:33:20.240 this is hard like things just start you just feel like resistance and then eventually usually after say mile three
02:33:26.800 all of a sudden I feel like oh I could do this forever i could do this the rest of the day if I wanted to but if I don't
02:33:33.040 go through that first three miles I'm never going to get to four plus or whatever it is and I do feel like that's the same um with writing where it's it's
02:33:41.040 challenging at first the things aren't moving but then things just things start to move you know and you but you need to
02:33:46.960 you need that buy in like you need the you're not going to have those amazing four plus miles after mile four or
02:33:54.880 sentence after the 20 paragraphs you deleted if you don't run the first three miles or write the first 20 paragraphs
02:34:02.720 and then a related question is um specifically about writing but it could carry over to school music or any sort
02:34:11.200 of um kind of pursuit um you said that some days getting 300 quality words
02:34:17.359 feels like an accomplishment other days you get 3,000 words do you think prior to the days that you got the 3,000 words
02:34:24.479 that your brain is processing it unconsciously do you think it all happens in the session or is there
02:34:29.840 something like if you look back into your days and and um hours before those
02:34:35.920 incredible days where you just feel amazing can you map it to anything or is it just mysterious
02:34:42.000 i think it's somewhat mysterious uh but I I guess here's how I would answer that is there's some
02:34:49.359 writing I've done where you sit down and it's just it comes out and it comes out
02:34:56.800 not needing many edits and it's just like like I'll give you an example um a lot there might be some bias um but a
02:35:04.319 lot of my friends and people who've read my work say one of the best things I've written is this essay I did about my mom
02:35:09.760 it originally appeared in Men's Health in 2017 maybe um it's called my badass mom
02:35:16.080 I I have it on my Substack i'll link to it in that um post i wrote that in about seven minutes
02:35:23.200 sat down and just and it's like a thousand something words and it was like printed it and was like I don't know if
02:35:30.240 I need to change this and so why is that because I've been thinking on that piece for 30 something years and it was just
02:35:37.359 that was the moment and just the energy got captured and then that was it
02:35:42.720 a good example of this and this is a person at a much higher level is um I was watching a Tom Petty documentary
02:35:50.800 apparently he sat down flipped on a recorder and just came up with Wild
02:35:56.160 Flowers literally started just playing those chords and making up the lyrics as he
02:36:01.680 went and recorded Wild Flowers just went "Holy shit." Right that is
02:36:07.280 like there are times when like magic happens and just lightning strikes and you got to be you just got to be there for it though it's like I think things
02:36:13.840 like that can happen but I think to your point why could that happen it's because he had like all this experience that
02:36:20.960 just sort of like was swelling and bubbling under and finally it just like converged
02:36:26.800 brings it me to a earlier point in our discussion i I genuinely believe that
02:36:34.399 the raw materials of great writing and music and science and uh you know
02:36:40.479 whatever podcasting uh visual art painting those raw materials are
02:36:45.760 collected away from the the actual craft and so you have to get out into the real world and experience those where have
02:36:52.000 you gotten your best material scientific work ideas you're flowing into podcasts
02:36:58.479 like how does all that unfold for you for me you know PubMed is um it's like the it's the
02:37:07.200 intellectual wilderness of published material as our books and lectures but
02:37:12.640 mostly PubMed so the more time I can spend foraging papers and looking at
02:37:18.319 graphs and seeing things and and connecting it to something else and um that's where you know the ideas those
02:37:25.120 are the raw materials yeah like like this year I haven't been doing quite as many solos as I work on the book but I'm
02:37:31.359 getting back to solos soon and I've got these like folders upon folders of papers that no one's ever discussed out
02:37:36.479 there that I think have real gems in them so those are that's those are the minds in which I'm mining for information that I then have to work
02:37:43.120 with so for me it's PubMed and occasionally it's getting on the phone like I did yesterday with a neurosurgeon
02:37:49.680 friend of mine and having a discussion about the Vegas nerve and realizing that everything that's out there about the
02:37:55.680 Vegas nerve everything is exactly backwards interesting and going and I was like is this possible and he's like
02:38:01.359 yeah and I'm like why hasn't the narrative been corrected and he's like well because there's never been a a a real neuroscientist talking about it i
02:38:07.760 was like "Oh wow we have it exactly backwards." Just for not to be cryptic here the vagus nerve even though it's
02:38:13.040 classified as parasympathetic is not a calming pathway it's a pathway by which physical movement wakes up the brain
02:38:20.800 period or mechanical changes in the gut wake up the bra it's all excitatory everyone thinks the vagus calm down no
02:38:26.720 the only quieting signals come from the brain to the body interesting and there are a few of them in there but the vast majority of the Vegas is this way that
02:38:33.120 the way to wake up your brain is to move your body so that's um anyway I don't want to go too far down this rabbit hole
02:38:38.880 this though this sounds like what I was just talking about when I'm in a place and having to find information for a
02:38:44.000 story and I experience it's that you use the word foraging right it's that that
02:38:50.560 like the chase of the the thing what's the thing I'm going to find here i got this question i got to go find these and
02:38:57.680 I don't know what I'm going to encounter out there in the wilderness as you put it that is the best
02:39:03.920 it's why people get hooked on social media it's why people get hooked on gambling it's why people get hooked on dating apps or whatever the hell it is i
02:39:10.240 think the problem today is that you see it getting put into um technology and
02:39:15.439 leveraged in a way that maybe hurts people over the long run whereas if you can find a way to leverage that as you
02:39:21.439 have and are telling me now that helps you in the long run that's like the unlock right yeah that's what a lot of
02:39:27.000 No text
02:39:28.080 these failure to launch um kids are are not
02:39:33.200 um accessing totally and Anna Lemi of you know the author of Dopamine Nation
02:39:38.240 has said this you know when she said like what what do you what are people who haven't found their passion supposed to do and she'll say mow the lawn and
02:39:44.240 people go this just sounds like a mom telling me what to do but she she understands it's the same circuitry
02:39:49.520 you're trying to get that that you do something you don't want to do you complete it it's job well done you're learning a process
02:39:56.479 and then you start to you know um superimpose the understanding of that process onto things that are hopefully
02:40:03.359 meaningful and and generative you know as opposed to destructive that the problem is it's like a trail where on
02:40:10.640 either side you can slip every day you can slip down the slope of numbing out or drama you're trying to stay on a
02:40:18.000 trail to keep it in the language of Michael Easter like you're trying to stay on a trail this narrow and you
02:40:23.200 don't know where it's going and it's splitting off and you don't know which is the right one and and there just so many opportunities to slide down the the
02:40:28.960 edges totally every day all day and those edges continuously get tweaked to
02:40:34.960 be slipperier easier to fall down steeper so in scarcity brain I um so I live in Las
02:40:43.120 Vegas right and so you see people playing slot machines all day long and there's slot machines everywhere and I
02:40:49.680 just look I go why do people do that because everyone knows the house always
02:40:55.200 wins right you want evidence why would there be those bajillion dollar casinos down there if people were actually
02:41:01.280 winning at gambling and I'll keep this story short but I ended up in this um
02:41:08.080 casino that's new but it's used entirely for research on gambling behavior um
02:41:15.200 levers I'll say that can be pulled in casinos to get people to effectively gamble more and it's funded by um
02:41:21.840 Caesars is one of the companies in it there's also a bunch of tech companies in there and I think that that is like a
02:41:29.040 metaphor for the world we live in where now because things can be tracked and digitized that like people who are using
02:41:37.359 this in a way where it's maybe arguably not helping people in the long run there's just so much
02:41:43.200 information that that saw can continuously be sharpened and sharpened and sharpened i think slot machines are
02:41:49.920 also just the ultimate metaphor because they um in the 80 up until about 1980 no one played them and um then you had a
02:41:58.479 guy come in in the 1980s his name was Cy Red and he had noticed that his kids his
02:42:05.600 grandkids would play Atari all day long he's like they just get hooked on Atari and he's like that's interesting
02:42:13.760 what can I take from that and apply to these machines that I make so what he
02:42:19.200 does is he makes the first screenbased slot machines and when slot machines go screenbased all of a sudden you can
02:42:27.280 program the odds rather than be constrained by actual spinning reels because there's only so many symbols you
02:42:33.280 can fit right so now you can offer this total crazy world of different combinations and jackpots and he
02:42:40.640 realizes oh what we can do because we have all these options now
02:42:45.920 is we can have people bet a bunch of different lines so on like a on a
02:42:51.520 digital slot machine you can bet like 40 different ways the line is going to go and the things are going to fill up and
02:42:58.000 what we can do from there is that if you get a win you might quote unquote win but let's say you bet a dollar you'll
02:43:03.920 win say 50 cents or 40 cents that is what casino companies call a loss
02:43:09.280 disguised as a win the thing is is when that happens to people doesn't necessarily register as a loss something
02:43:17.200 exciting happened right and so all of a sudden the machine can start have something exciting happen far more times
02:43:25.040 but you're just slowly losing your money instead of quickly losing your money so the reason that people weren't playing
02:43:30.960 slot machines up to 1980 is because simply by the constraints of space and
02:43:36.240 the way that reels were like physical reels you just couldn't win all that often so you might play 20 games and you
02:43:43.359 nothing ever happens so that behavior is going to extinguish like really quick but if you can get someone on a machine
02:43:49.200 where like maybe every third pull maybe every second pull something happens the
02:43:56.080 machine lights up ding ding ding ding ding congratulations you won you won 40 cents on your dollar bat isn't this
02:44:02.240 exciting congratulations and welcome to Las Vegas now all of a sudden you start to see slot machines go from like being
02:44:07.520 thrown in the corners of casinos to taking over casino floors so they now bring in 85% of uh casino revenues and
02:44:15.120 people spend more money on slot machines than they do uh books movies and music combined and it was really just this
02:44:22.080 tweaking of this perfect reward schedule where you're getting just the right
02:44:27.520 amount of rewards at a random schedule and it's just been sharpened and then you see companies go
02:44:35.120 "What the hell's happening in Vegas?" And then that gets placed into social media into dating apps into online
02:44:42.240 shopping like you go on shopping places now there's a damn spinning wheel right to get a discount it's like that's what
02:44:48.640 happens when you walk into a Las Vegas casino too first thing you see is a spinning wheel because it's a suckers game and then just spread everywhere
02:44:57.279 wow yeah and the speed speed is a big thing so the other thing with the
02:45:03.040 spinning reels when it's physical you pull this handle it's a slow process
02:45:08.560 pull clunk clunk clunk okay pull clunk clunk clunk so the CI red guy he
02:45:15.359 realizes hey this pulling the handle thing that's just slowing people down what if we made the spin a button and
02:45:21.279 what happened is the average slot gamer went from playing 400 games an hour to 900 games an hour
02:45:29.200 yeah swipe right swipe left swipe right swipe left whoa infinite scroll
02:45:37.439 right infinite pages that just load as you shop you want no friction everything
02:45:42.800 needs to be frictionless the faster you can do a behavior the more likely you are to do a behavior and this all got
02:45:49.279 figured out in this strange heartless but freaking beautiful town I
02:45:55.920 live in called Las Vegas wow yeah i would love to go to a casino with you sometimes just sometime just to
02:46:02.080 like watch you analyze people and be like that's what's happening to this person well you their baseline on dopamine is dropping they'll get the
02:46:06.000 No text
02:46:08.240 little inflections the wins or the perceived wins right what you don't perceive is your baseline right right
02:46:14.560 we're not in touch with our dopamine baseline we're in touch with the inflections from that baseline and and that can be very distracting i mean and
02:46:21.520 there's a whole set of parallel conversations about addiction here uh I mean this is what you just described um
02:46:29.600 makes me remember what Anna LMK one of our first guests ever on this podcast right as Dopamine Nation um was
02:46:36.160 published said which was that her formerly addicted patients who get sober
02:46:43.680 from whatever cannabis alcohol gambling whatever it is that they are her heroes
02:46:49.840 and I thought oh that's beautiful right she her patients are her heroes what what more beautiful thing could a doctor
02:46:56.479 say she's an MD after all and now she's saying "No no i not only do I respect
02:47:01.760 and admire them but they're my heroes because they are better equipped to deal with the landscape of life than people
02:47:08.479 who have not experienced the deep hole
02:47:13.840 that addiction can bring and then getting themselves out of it and understanding these dopamine dynamics these catakolamine circuits as I'm
02:47:20.319 referring to them." That's what she was saying she wasn't saying they overcame a lot i mean she was saying that too but
02:47:26.160 it was that they understand life at a deep level to be able to go into the world now and to really glean tremendous
02:47:33.439 meaning and benefit from the smallest of things and that's where I distilled it down to as I needed to make it uh
02:47:39.520 succinct for social media ironically to the statement that addiction is a progressive narrowing of the things that
02:47:46.319 bring us pleasure and that happiness or maybe even enlightenment if there is such a thing is a progressive expansion
02:47:52.880 of the things that bring us pleasure but what she's saying is these people were in the pit got out of the pit and
02:47:57.920 therefore she admires them so um gosh I want to visit this um very diabolical
02:48:04.800 casino i guess all casinos are kind of diabolical i actually really like gambling um my team knows this um I do
02:48:11.120 too i really enjoy it i I it changes my um internal kind of RPM
02:48:19.600 this vague language here but when I I play uh a little roulette or I'll like
02:48:24.720 just I don't know gamble on a on a game or something like I can feel the lift it gives me which is why I don't gamble i
02:48:32.479 know myself and I can feel that thing it's like a it's an energy that feels kind of like throughout the body and and
02:48:39.600 you're unaware of of really um anything else it's a little bit of a tunnel and
02:48:44.880 I've never gambled much money i've never thought to but I recognize that feeling and I'm like "Oh no." Yeah yeah you You
02:48:52.080 have it too i enjoy it i also once I hit a certain amount of and I keep my
02:48:58.399 threshold very low for when I'm going to gamble because I live in Las Vegas like probably not a good idea to get really
02:49:03.680 into gambling if you live in a town where it's everywhere like you go to the grocery store and you can gamble um so I
02:49:10.560 keep it pretty low we gamble like once a month i mean we're like you know we're not spending much money but it's
02:49:15.680 enjoyable that's that's the thing right is like with so many things that can be
02:49:20.800 um addictive is there's vastly more people that can go in have a little bit
02:49:27.359 of fun that was a good time and then move on with their life and then there's a small subset of the population that
02:49:33.359 gets for whatever reason it's that thing that does it for them and it sucks them in there's also because we're talking
02:49:40.000 about gambling and addiction there's uh some research i believe this
02:49:45.840 woman was at NYU and she studied uh problem gamblers and went to Las Vegas interviewed a bunch of them and she
02:49:52.080 found that a lot of the seriously problem gamblers when they would get a
02:49:57.520 big win it would piss them off and here's why because when you get a big win if it's over $1,200 what happens is
02:50:04.560 your machine locks up and the casino boss pit he comes over and he makes you
02:50:10.240 fill out a tax form because you know once you get over $1,200 now you got to pay taxes on it they weren't there
02:50:16.080 necessarily to win they were there to just get in the flow of the machine and just have the ups and the downs and just
02:50:22.240 like ride that out and having a big win it would interrupt that and that would frustrate him which is just nuts the way
02:50:29.000 No text
02:50:29.600 you offer up these real life examples for me and I know for the listeners provides such a rich um substrate for
02:50:37.200 for understanding the the kind of universal circuitry and I'm so grateful to you for that you talked earlier about
02:50:43.760 the the speed of the of the slot machine so what I think is very dangerous
02:50:49.920 um and we talked about before on this podcast is um this notion of dopamine that's not preceded by effort but I
02:50:56.800 think you said it best and I'd like to replace that with something that's uh much more fasile for people and hopefully intuitive as well basically
02:51:04.720 anytime we find ourselves in frictionless or low friction foraging
02:51:10.720 we're in serious trouble get out get out then like the moment you you're in a
02:51:16.240 frictionless foraging mode your your baseline's dropping and you don't realize it totally a good exa a good
02:51:22.560 example of a way this was used um relatively recently that has I think been disastrous especially for younger
02:51:29.600 men is in um sports betting so sports betting gets you know legalized in a
02:51:36.720 bunch of different states well it used to be that in order to place a sports bet you had to drive to the casino and
02:51:43.920 you could bet on the game that was hours away and then maybe you would watch the full game at the casino how long does a
02:51:50.560 game take three hours so you wait at the casino and then you either cash in or you know you lost your bet well once it
02:51:58.080 gets sort of legalized and now it's in all these different states and it goes to cell phones okay so now it's like I
02:52:04.000 don't even have to drive to the casino i can do this right now through two buttons and then one thing that the
02:52:09.680 gambling industry did that was good for the profits probably not good for the user is to go okay well if we know that
02:52:16.960 speed will increase gambling rates and the more a person gamles we can look at the math and go we just need them to
02:52:22.880 gamble more because that's how we win our money it's in the volume um what can
02:52:28.560 we do to solve this problem of the fact that a game is three hours long because how many games are there in a day wait a
02:52:35.600 minute what if you could bet on a play how many plays are there in a game i don't know hundreds okay let's bet on
02:52:42.720 this play so now you have like these live in-game thing like is this person going to score up to bat is this There's all these different ways a person can
02:52:49.120 bet and then the addition of uh parlays as well where you've got like 12 teams
02:52:54.560 or whatever and like these like bonus things they throw in it's just like it
02:53:00.000 is a train wreck when you said there's a growing problem
02:53:06.160 nowadays among young men I thought you were going to talk about frictionless foraging and online pornography oh yeah
02:53:12.800 that's we got we got plenty of problems and so what I'm realizing is there are numerous examples of this out there but
02:53:19.439 hopefully this framework of um rate and um low frict low friction high-speed
02:53:25.120 foraging means you're you're just gonna end up in a pit yeah totally you gota
02:53:32.160 figure out ways to slow things down if you can i think there's I think it's hard but I think there's ways to do it
02:53:37.359 um another interesting example and this one isn't I don't think is as sort of onetoone as the others we've been
02:53:43.279 talking about but there's a guy from junk from the junk food industry and you see this rise in junk food in the 1970s
02:53:50.080 and what happened is um sort of like the casinos looking at sports going well like well these things are long there's
02:53:56.080 long stretches between these events um in the 70s the food industry was like
02:54:01.120 well people are eating three square we need them to eat more food what if we invent snacking let's make snacking a
02:54:07.439 big industry so they start they come up with this new thing snacking right like snacking becomes this thing and this guy
02:54:14.240 from the junk food industry basically said if you want to get a um a junk food
02:54:19.520 to sell and take off it's got to have three V's it's got to have value it's
02:54:24.880 got to have variety and it's got to have velocity meaning cheap meaning lots of
02:54:31.120 different options so think of Doritos there's like 10 different flavors right you got nacho cheese normal cheese chili
02:54:36.720 cheese whatever on and on uh and then velocity it's got to be quick and easy to eat it's got to be a food that you
02:54:43.040 can just pound a bunch of calories in one sitting and want to just keep going and once they sort of lock that in you
02:54:48.640 start to see that's really you start to see obesity take off in the 70s in the US or mental obesity and Tik Tok yeah
02:54:57.520 seriously i mean again these these uh these parallels between the physical and
02:55:02.720 the cognitive right you know it's I mean uh there's a incredible moment in the the Bad Men series where they bring a a
02:55:10.399 um a vending machine into the office and suddenly you know like people are eating at work before they would leave to to go
02:55:16.240 eat no one was eating at their desk right i remember uh when I was a postocck no excuse me when I was a
02:55:21.840 graduate student so this would be 2000 to 2004 when I was doing my PhD we had a German postoc come from overseas and um
02:55:31.120 and he was just blown away that people would take their coffee in their car now
02:55:38.240 you hear this you're like of course he was like this is crazy like you would go to the cafe you would drink your coffee or you would make a coffee at work after
02:55:44.319 lunch and then drink it in the lunchroom and then go back to your bench and But everyone's walking around he's like
02:55:49.920 "Everyone's walking around with their coffee all the time." Like "What's going on here?" You know now he's a professor up at the University of Oregon i bet you
02:55:56.560 he uh he carries his coffee around yeah he's been here a while but um he was like "This is crazy." Yeah like people
02:56:03.279 carry their drinks around you know and now you'd be uh you'd be hardressed to find someone not carrying their coffee
02:56:09.120 out of a coffee shop most it's it's more like a like a fast food restaurant you're trying to get people in and out as fast as possible yeah and and
02:56:16.000 snacking in general just food eating food in all sorts of situations too I think is is relatively new i mean if we
02:56:22.000 No text
02:56:22.560 were getting more productive and there was more incredible creative work I'd say okay fine like it's all in service
02:56:28.160 to something else but once again we land ourselves in the in the landscape of neuroscience where it's one circuit so
02:56:35.520 um I don't believe how you do one thing is how you do everything otherwise based on my strawberry hole example earlier like I'm really in trouble yeah but I
02:56:42.640 believe that we have areas of life where we are a little bit uh less regimented in
02:56:47.920 others where we're even just like outright neurotic but I do think that
02:56:53.120 once we start to see these patterns and where they are um hopefully it helps people navigate better uh I mean I think
02:56:59.359 the way you described they're making the the the the slopes on the that narrow trail very
02:57:05.680 like steeper and steeper it's getting more perilous to be a human it's getting riskier harder despite
02:57:12.080 these conveniences and it's it's no coincidence it's it's because of the conveniences yeah and I think too one of
02:57:17.840 the issues is we face is that a lot of this is is all technologically driven um
02:57:23.600 but one of the issues becomes that um it's becoming harder and harder than
02:57:28.640 ever to opt out of the technology so I'll give you an example is I have this uh uncle and um he's old school
02:57:37.439 railroad worker not a big fan of people does best when he's in his 1960s bus up
02:57:44.560 in the mountains just alone awesome awesome dude far out um he was totally
02:57:50.640 anti- getting a smartphone he's like "No I'm not getting a damn smartphone." Like "No no way." Well now that guy can't
02:57:55.840 even get on a plane if he wanted to without a smartphone right so like there's all these things in life that
02:58:02.319 you normal you basically have to do to function that run through a smartphone and by the way the smartphone is the
02:58:08.720 thing that is making you crazy so you can't even opt out of the technology and that's where it starts to get scary one
02:58:15.520 thing that I've done that's been very helpful for me is I put social media so Instagram and X on a on an old phone
02:58:23.680 that's smart so if people send me something like if you were to send me a clip on Instagram I can't on my normal phone i I can't look at it i mean I
02:58:30.240 suppose you can go in through the the annoying thing where you have to cancel out some windows but I just don't do it and by the end of the day no one writes
02:58:36.479 to me and goes "What do you think of that thing I sent you?" you know so um so I make very designated time that I'm
02:58:42.479 on social media and then you know I don't access it elsewhere but it is
02:58:47.760 tough i we have the fact that we have to set up these barriers but you're doing incredible work i I must say I I think
02:58:54.560 of you as a researcher even though you're a writer you research things in depth uh for your writing and uh it's
02:59:02.880 clear you put so much care and time and thought into your craft and I've loved your book The Comfort Crisis i uh we'll
02:59:10.880 put links to all your books and to the Substack links that were uh discussed today um I'm curious what the next book
02:59:18.160 is i feel like you should write a book about addiction and dopamine and you know how to overcome it you might have the the I I know that you have the
02:59:24.800 recipe he told us the recipe today um can you share with us what it's about or is that like parents who are expecting a
02:59:31.520 kid revealing the name before it's born you're not supposed to i think it'll be a mental health extension of the comfort
02:59:37.359 crisis and um a little bit of a case for adventure and you know I think the
02:59:43.840 question that I really grapple with is why when you look at our world sort of
02:59:49.120 objectively things have never been up better than ever look at all the numbers like we're living longer more people
02:59:55.600 know how to read fewer people are hungry you can get from point A to point B in like 30 minutes it used to take you you
03:00:02.240 know a entire day to walk that all these things and yet people are less satisfied
03:00:07.359 and more neurotic than ever so it's like well why is that and then what is the answer to it so I think the book will
03:00:13.920 probably get into that somehow with the with the uh my long hike I just did being the overarching narrative and some
03:00:20.319 lessons I learned along the way awesome yeah um and let me thank you for having
03:00:25.680 me on doing the work that you're doing you're changing a lot of lives man um I can't tell you the number of people
03:00:31.920 because I I got sober when I was 28 i can't tell you the number of people who have reached out and said "I watched
03:00:38.399 this Huberman episode and I decided to stop drinking and my life is way better." And that's like bam that's like
03:00:45.279 all happening right here and the amount of people that's rippled to and changed and not just them because when one
03:00:52.080 person stops drinking it's not just their life that improves everyone in their orbit's life improves if they
03:00:58.319 drink like I did and so that's awesome and everything else you're doing is awesome so I really appreciate you
03:01:03.600 having me man thank you uh I'll take that in and I want to thank you for coming here today and for uh sharing
03:01:10.880 with us your knowledge and wisdom it went places I didn't anticipate and as always I learn from you uh as I started
03:01:17.040 off today's conversation by saying you've completely changed my life because I do things differently every single day i look at the friction points
03:01:24.399 of like I don't want to do this as like opportunities and I do think it's made uh my life better and hopefully me
03:01:30.479 better for the other people in my life i also curse you every day decide to save this to the end i have a 72lb kettlebell
03:01:38.000 set in my living room and when I wake up in the morning I pick it up and I suitcase carry it
03:01:44.319 back and forth once with one arm and I suitcase carry it back and forth with the other arm and the entire time I'm
03:01:49.359 cursing you because awesome it hurts it doesn't feel good to do first thing in the morning my grip isn't as strong as
03:01:55.680 it is in the midm morning after a cup of coffee and um I have this little forearm twinge thing but I told myself if I do
03:02:01.920 this every single day then I'll be able to um continue to do it the rest of my
03:02:07.040 life it'll probably make me live longer and that's a that's a uh Michael Easter
03:02:12.160 um curse cursing carry process done every single day so you've changed my
03:02:17.600 life for the better in uh some painful ways that pay off certainly with less pain down the road um and certainly with
03:02:23.520 more meaning so really want to thank you for everything you're doing you put so much intention and heart into what you're doing and thanks also for sharing
03:02:29.840 a bit about um addiction about the value of going to
03:02:35.439 meetings and um and the landscape that we're all facing out there it's not easy but you're making it better i appreciate
03:02:41.840 it i'll make you a deal i'm going to do the same thing every morning i'm going to get my 72 pound kettle bell and I'm
03:02:48.080 going to join you in those morning walks and then I will be cursing your name from now on so it'll be fair perfect
