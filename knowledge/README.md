## How to Add Knowledge

1. Simply drop your `.txt` or `.md` files into this folder
2. Restart the agent (`python main.py`)
3. The agent will automatically load all documents

## Tips

- Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `product-manual.txt`, `faq.md`)
- Break large documents into smaller, focused topics
- The agent works best with clear, well-structured content
